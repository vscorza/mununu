## 1. The construction

The SVA translator cannot express `$past(b)` as an atom — there is no signal in
the model holding "b, one cycle ago". So the BTOR2 gains one:

```
n     state <sort> b__past
n+1   next  <sort> n <b>
n+2   init  <sort> n <v>        ; v = b's own init (state base) or zero (input base)
```

`b` is either a BTOR2 state cell or a primary input;
[`resolve_shadow_source`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/shadow.rs)
tries a unique exact state symbol, then an exact input symbol, then the
symbol-distance cone walk. The atom `$past(b)` then translates to the ordinary
signal reference `b__past`.

This is the same move [`free-input-atoms.md`](free-input-atoms.md) is about, in
its temporal form: convert a reference the abstraction cannot bind into a state
reference it can.

## 2. Why it is sound: history variables

`b__past` is a **history variable** in the Abadi–Lamport sense: its next-state
value is a function of the current state and inputs, and nothing in the design
reads it. Two consequences, and they are the whole argument.

**It adds no behaviour.** Let `M` be the original system over variables `V` and
`M'` the augmented one over `V ∪ {b__past}`. The projection `π : S' → S` that
forgets `b__past` is a *functional bisimulation*: every `M'` transition projects
to an `M` transition, and every `M` transition lifts to exactly one `M'`
transition per source state. So for any formula `φ` over `V` alone,

> `M', s' ⊨ φ  ⟺  M, π(s') ⊨ φ`

The augmentation is a **conservative extension**. It cannot create or destroy a
counterexample to any property that does not mention the shadow.

**It removes no behaviour.** `next(b__past) = b` is total — it constrains only the
new variable, never `b`. This is the specific reason a *prophecy* variable would
need a different argument and a history variable does not: prophecy variables
guess the future and can prune traces; history variables record the past and
cannot.

Nothing above distinguishes a register base from an input base. `next` sourced
from an `input` node is well-formed BTOR2 with exactly the intended meaning — the
flop samples the input at cycle `t` and presents it at `t+1`. The old restriction
to state cells was conservative, not semantic.

## 3. The initial state — the one place the argument stops

A history variable has no defined value before the first transition, and §2 says
nothing about it. Two cases:

- **State base.** The shadow mirrors the source's `init`, so `b__past == b` at
  cycle 0 — the "no history before the first clock edge" convention. If the
  source has no `init`, neither does the shadow, and the pair moves together
  under whatever a given engine does with an init-less cell.
- **Input base.** There is no `init` to mirror, so a value is *chosen*. That
  choice is an approximation, and §4 explains why it is a choice at all.

**When is the chosen value observable?** Exactly when a property reads the shadow
in the initial state — and the lift settles that structurally. `nu X. (body && [] X)`
evaluates `body` at every reachable state *including the initial one*, and the two
implication forms place the consequent differently:

| SVA | lifted formula | reads the invented value? |
|---|---|---|
| `push \|-> d0_q == $past(din)` | `nu X. ((!push \|\|    (d0_q == din__past)) && [] X)` | **yes** — atom outside `[]` |
| `push \|=> d0_q == $past(din)` | `nu X. ((!push \|\| [] (d0_q == din__past)) && [] X)` | no — atom under `[]` |

Under `[]` the atom is only ever read at a state that *has* a predecessor, where
the shadow holds a value the design actually drove. So the approximation is
invisible to every `|=>` shape — which is every data-integrity property, because
"sample an antecedent, check the result one cycle later" is what `|=>` means — and
visible to `|->`.

Pinned by `only_a_same_cycle_past_reads_the_invented_history` in
[`tests/past_shadow_input_e2e.rs`](../../crates/mununu-core/tests/past_shadow_input_e2e.rs),
so a future change to the lift that moved the atom out from under `[]` would fail
a test rather than silently widen the approximation.

## 4. Why the input shadow is pinned rather than left free

Leaving it free is the more faithful reading of SVA, where `$past` is undefined
before the first clock edge. It is not a choice this adapter can make.

An init-less BTOR2 state cell means **different things to different engines**. The
cube and exact engines default it to 0 (`state_cell_init_values` /
`initial_state_bdd`, per the `setundef -zero` power-up); the reachability
portfolio leaves it FREE, per BTOR2's nondeterministic-init semantics. That is
precisely the verdict disagreement
[`reset_init::inject_zero_init`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/reset_init.rs)
exists to close — and it cannot close this one, because it runs on the
pre-augmentation BTOR2, before the shadow is appended. A free shadow escapes the
mitigation by construction.

So the shadow carries an explicit `init 0`, and every engine decides the same
model. What is given up is bounded by §3 and stated at the code.

> The `init` value's NID must be **below** the state's: btormc's parser requires
> it. mununu's own parser is order-agnostic, so the wrong order reads fine
> in-process and is rejected by the external oracle — a portfolio failure, not a
> parse error. The zero is therefore allocated before the flop.

## 5. Interaction with the KMTS fixpoint

The lift abstracts the augmented BTOR2 into predicate cubes with a may relation
(over-approximating the concrete transitions) and a must relation
(under-approximating them), and evaluates the μ-calculus 3-valued in the sense of
Bruns–Godefroid. Two things matter for the shadow.

**The shadow is what makes the atom bindable at all.** A cube is a valuation over
predicates on *state* variables. `$past(b)` names no state, so before the
augmentation the property translated to a formula over a name absent from the
model and every engine reported `skipped — predicate references unknown
register/signal`. After it, `b__past` is an ordinary state variable and predicates
over it partition cubes like any other. That is the entire point of the trick.

**The 3-valued modalities depend on `R_must ⊆ R_may`.** From
[`symbolic.rs`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/mu_calculus/symbolic.rs):

```text
[]φ.must = ∀ R_may.  φ.must        <>φ.must = ∃ R_must. φ.must
[]φ.may  = ∀ R_must. φ.may         <>φ.may  = ∃ R_may.  φ.may
```

The internal invariant every node must satisfy is `must ⊑ may`. For the box that
reduces to: *if all may-successors definitely satisfy φ, then all must-successors
possibly satisfy φ* — which holds given `φ.must ⊑ φ.may` **if and only if
`R_must ⊆ R_may`**. That containment is an obligation on the lift, not a theorem
about it; §6 is what happens when it is not met.

## 6. Two defects this surfaced

Both are **pre-existing** and reproduce identically on a *register*-sourced
`$past`, so neither comes from input support. A property with no `$past` is
unaffected in both postures. All three designs below are correct.

| posture | no `$past` | `$past` of a register | `$past` of an input |
|---|---|---|---|
| default (may-only) | Holds | Holds | Holds |
| `symbolic_engine: true` | Unknown | **panic** | **panic** |
| `must_edge_inference: SmtPerTarget` | Holds | **Violated** (false) | **Violated** (false) |

They look like one root cause. `kmts_lift.rs`'s must-edge post-pass iterates
`sampled_targets_per_source` and adds a `Sharp` transition for every pair the SMT
check accepts — **without checking that the pair is in the may relation.** Nothing
in the loop enforces `R_must ⊆ R_may`. When it is violated:

- the symbolic engine trips `TritBdd::from_parts`'s `debug_assert!` — which is
  compiled out in release, so the release failure mode is an inconsistent
  `TritBdd` and a **wrong verdict**, not a crash;
- the explicit engine resolves ⊥ cells against a must-path that does not exist
  concretely, and reports `Violated` for a correct design.

Until that is fixed, `must_edge_inference: Off` (the default) is the only sound
posture for a `$past` property. A definite HOLDS transfers — may over-approximation
plus a safety property. Refuting a *data-dependent* violation needs must-edges, so
today such a violation lands on ⊥ rather than VIOLATED; widening the data to one
bit, raising `max_iterations`, and predicate hints on both the source and the
shadow were each measured and all stay at ⊥.

## 7. Stutter equivalence — why nothing here may ever assume it

`$past` counts clock edges, and `|=>` is a *next-step* operator. The `[]` and `<>`
above are next-step modalities, and next-step μ-calculus is **not**
stutter-invariant: a transformation that preserves only stutter equivalence —
partial-order reduction, self-loop collapsing, step compression, any
"finite-stuttering" quotient — silently changes the meaning of every `$past`
property while preserving ordinary invariants.

mununu contains no such transformation. `grep -ri stutter` over the crate and the
docs returns nothing, and the lift is a step-exact predicate image: one abstract
transition per concrete one. So every engine preserves step count and the shadow
is safe under all of them.

This section exists because that fact is **invisible** — it is a property of what
the codebase does *not* do. The constraint it records is on future work: any
step-collapsing optimisation must exclude models carrying `__past` shadows, or
`$past` properties become quietly wrong rather than loudly broken.

## 8. Per-engine ledger

| engine | status on a `$past` model |
|---|---|
| reach portfolio (btormc / pono / Boolector) | **Exact.** Consumes the BTOR2 directly; the shadow is a real flop. Requires the `init` value's NID to precede the state's — see §4. |
| exact-symbolic (ROBDD, 2-valued) | **Exact** on the augmented model. Independently refuses any property whose atom names a primary input (`push \|=> …`), because it leaves inputs free and a formula pinning one would decouple antecedent from consequent. It says so and skips rather than guessing. |
| explicit / symbolic cube, `must_edge_inference: Off` | **Sound for HOLDS** (may over-approximation + safety). Cannot refute a data-dependent violation; reports ⊥. |
| explicit / symbolic cube, must-edge inference on | **Sound at the lift (2026-08-28, §6 update box)** — the vacuous must out of an empty cube that caused the false `Violated` is no longer created, and `assert_must_subset_may` gates any residual. e2e confirmation in `mununu-sva` pending. Was **unsound** pre-fix — §6. |
| `symbolic_engine: true` | **No longer fed an inconsistent KMTS (2026-08-28)** — the lift enforces `R_must ⊆ R_may` before `TritBdd::from_parts`, so the debug panic / release miscompute of §6 cannot arise from a `$past` model. Was **panic (debug) / wrong verdict (release)** pre-fix — §6. |

## 9. What is argued vs verified vs gap

- **Argued** (§2): the augmentation is a conservative extension. Standard history-variable
  reasoning; no mununu-specific hypothesis.
- **Verified** (§3, §4): the `|=>` / `|->` boundary and the shadow's presence in the
  model are pinned by tests in `tests/past_shadow_input_e2e.rs`, run against live
  slang + yosys in the `mununu-sva` image.
- **Measured** (§6): the two defects, and the ⊥ ceiling for refutation, reproduced
  across four engine postures and two data widths (pre-fix).
- **Gap — CLOSED at the lift (2026-08-28, §6 update box).** `R_must ⊆ R_may` is now
  enforced where must-edges are created: the ∀∃ must is restricted to the emitted
  may-relation (Fix A), proven-empty source cubes are excluded from must-promotion
  (Fix B), and a per-lift `assert_must_subset_may` rejects any residual containment
  violation before the evaluator (Fix C). Mechanism-level unit tests pass; the
  remaining confirmation is the e2e `$past` reproduction in the `mununu-sva` image
  (host runs cannot exercise slang), which should show the §6 `Violated`/`panic`
  entries turn into a sound `holds`/`violated`, and a genuine data-dependent
  violation reach a definite `VIOLATED` rather than ⊥.
