# §Phase 10 UF-mode routing architecture

> **Status: planning** — describes the chosen routing for §Phase 10 stages 3.b + 3.c implementation. Code anchors are pre-implementation references; the `Source of truth` anchors graduate to live citations once stage 3.b ships.

## Problem statement

§Phase 10 §10.2 stage 2 shipped a sidecar schema with four memory-abstraction modes: `havoc`, `uf`, `bit_blast`, `bounded_bit_blast`. Stages 1+1b shipped the recognition pipeline and the `havoc` rewriting. Stage 3.a (commit `46b15a3`) shipped the UF-mode recognition + a UF-specific is_blastable error hint. **Stages 3.b + 3.c remain.**

The naive reading of the §Phase 10 stage-3 plan ("BTOR2 rewriting + Z3 Array theory in `kripke_smt`") suggests UF rides the same `bit_blast::translate` path that `havoc` rides today. **That reading is wrong.** The bit-blaster fundamentally cannot process Read/Write on array-sorted operands — it enumerates concrete state cubes (`combo: usize` indexing each state-cell's value space). An array-sorted state cell has no finite-width enumeration, so any combo-indexed enumeration over an array is undefined. The havoc rewriting sidesteps this by deleting the array entirely (Read → Input, Write/Init/Next dropped). UF mode must preserve the array semantics — havoc-style deletion would defeat the abstraction's purpose.

The right routing is to dispatch UF-declared memories to the **predicate-cube lift** path ([`predicate_cube_lift`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/kmts_lift.rs)), which already operates symbolically (R.5b UF wrapping at [`kmts_lift.rs:646`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/kmts_lift.rs#L646)). The bit-blaster stays out of the UF-mode loop entirely.

## Routing decision

When `SvAnnotation::memories[].abstraction == Uf` for at least one memory, the BTOR2 adapter routes through `predicate_cube_lift` instead of `bit_blast::translate`. The dispatch decision is made in [`crate::adapter::btor2::Btor2Adapter::translate`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/mod.rs) (or its caller in the API / CLI surface).

### Why the predicate-cube path, not an extended bit-blaster

- **R.5b UF wrapping infrastructure is already there.** [`kmts_lift.rs::collect_uf_wrapped_nids`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/bit_blast.rs) reads the sidecar's `uf_wrap` list and walks them through the predicate-image SMT queries. Extending the same map to carry array sorts (in addition to bit-vector sorts) is the "narrow extension" the §Phase 10 stage-3 plan called for — it matches `evaluate_pure`'s existing UF-substitution shape ([`kmts_lift.rs:1242`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/kmts_lift.rs#L1242)).
- **The predicate-cube state space is symbolic.** Each cube is a conjunction of predicate equalities `{p_1, ¬p_2, p_3, ...}`; there is no per-cell concrete enumeration. Array-typed cells coexist with bit-vector cells naturally; the predicate-image SMT query handles all sorts uniformly.
- **`kripke_smt::discover_significant_values`** ([`systemverilog/kripke_smt.rs:20`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/systemverilog/kripke_smt.rs#L20)) already operates at the SMT layer. Extending it to emit Z3 Array `select`/`store` for memory-typed registers is a localized addition — no bit-blaster surgery required.
- **Future cohesion.** Once stage 3.b + 3.c ship, the routing decision is: small fixtures with no memory → bit-blast (cheap); fixtures with memory → predicate-cube lift. The two paths stay disjoint per the §Phase 10 plan's "no parallel pipelines" discipline.

### Why NOT the obvious alternatives

- **Loosen `is_blastable` for UF Read/Write.** Would let the IR through but the downstream bit-blast enumeration would fail with a less specific error than today's (which explicitly names stages 3+4). Worse user experience; no architectural gain.
- **Extend the bit-blaster to support arrays.** Would require symbolic state representation everywhere a state cell is touched — `CellEnumeration::value_at`, `make_step_env`, `compute_next_state`, `build_state_valuations`, every transition relation construction site. Massive refactor that duplicates work the predicate-cube lift already does.
- **Skip the BTOR2 lifter entirely for UF; route to AVR.** Per the pillow plan's existing architecture, AVR is the external symbolic engine for designs beyond the explicit-state cap; it does NOT consume `SvAnnotation::memories` schema. Routing UF to AVR loses the sidecar-declared abstraction discipline. Mononu's in-process path (predicate-cube lift) preserves it.

## Code-level changes (stage 3.b + 3.c)

### Stage 3.b — routing dispatch (~1 session)

**File:** `crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/mod.rs` (the entry-point for BTOR2 adapter dispatch). New helper:

```rust
/// §Phase 10 stage 3.b — decide which lift path handles this BTOR2
/// + sidecar combination. UF-declared memories route through
/// `predicate_cube_lift`; everything else (no memories, only havoc,
/// only bit-blastable) routes through `bit_blast::translate`.
fn requires_uf_routing(content: &str, options: &AdapterOptions) -> bool {
    // Parse the BTOR2 to detect any memory cells.
    let file = match parser::parse(content) { Ok(f) => f, Err(_) => return false };
    let memory_cells = bit_blast::detect_btor2_memories(&file);
    if memory_cells.is_empty() {
        return false;
    }
    // Sidecar must declare at least one of them with `abstraction: uf`.
    let uf_nids = bit_blast::sidecar_uf_memory_nids(&memory_cells, options);
    !uf_nids.is_empty()
}

impl FormatAdapter for Btor2Adapter {
    fn translate(content: &str, options: &AdapterOptions)
        -> Result<AdapterOutput, AdapterError>
    {
        if requires_uf_routing(content, options) {
            return uf_lift_to_adapter_output(content, options);
        }
        bit_blast::translate_to_adapter_output(content, options)
    }
}
```

Stage 3.b's commit ships the routing decision + a stub `uf_lift_to_adapter_output` that calls `predicate_cube_lift` with the sidecar's predicate set (empty for now — stage 3.c populates) + returns an `AdapterError` for the array-handling parts. The dispatch is correct; the destination function is partial. Integration tests pin the dispatch.

The existing `sidecar_uf_memory_nids` helper (shipped at `46b15a3`) becomes `pub(crate)` so the routing dispatcher in `mod.rs` can call it. The is_blastable error path stage 3.a installed stays in place as a defensive fallback — if dispatch fails to fire (e.g. malformed sidecar), the bit-blaster still emits the stage-3.a hint.

### Stage 3.c — Z3 Array theory + kripke_smt extension (~2 sessions)

**File:** `crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/systemverilog/kripke_smt.rs::discover_significant_values`. Today it builds Z3 bit-vector terms via the `z3::ast::BV` family. Extension:

- Add `z3::ast::Array` term construction for state cells whose BTOR2 sort is `Sort::Array { index_width, element_width }`.
- For `Op::Read(arr, idx)`: emit `Array::select(&arr_ast, &idx_ast)`.
- For `Op::Write(arr, idx, val)`: emit `Array::store(&arr_ast, &idx_ast, &val_ast)`.
- Thread the array-typed cell through the existing per-step state-cell map (`HashMap<Nid, BV>` becomes `HashMap<Nid, Z3Term>` where `Z3Term` is an enum over `BV(BV)` and `Arr(Array)`).
- Functional-consistency axioms (`read(write(a, i, v), j) = if i==j then v else read(a, j)`) are emitted automatically by Z3's Array theory — no explicit axiom encoding needed.

**File:** `crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/kmts_lift.rs::evaluate_pure`. Mirror the same array-term handling in the pure (UF-wrapped) evaluator. Use a `Z3Term` enum if the BV-only `BV` type doesn't suffice. The R.5b UF wrapping check at `kmts_lift.rs:1242` (`if ctx.uf_wrapped_nids.is_empty()`) gets a parallel branch for array-sorted UF.

**File:** `crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/kmts_lift.rs::PredicateCubeLiftOptions`. Add a `uf_memories: HashMap<String, MemoryAnnotation>` field carrying the sidecar's UF-memory declarations. The lift consumer wires it from the BTOR2 adapter's dispatch (stage 3.b above).

## Open questions (track during stage 3.b + 3.c implementation)

1. **`Z3Term` enum vs separate Array path.** The bit-vector branch in `kripke_smt` is highly tuned. Adding an `Array(z3::ast::Array)` variant to every match arm is intrusive. The alternative is two parallel code paths (one for bit-vec-only state, one for mixed) — duplication cost vs uniform-term-handling cost. **Mitigation:** prototype the enum approach in stage 3.c first; fall back to parallel paths if the match coverage proves unwieldy.
2. **`selected_addresses` interaction.** The sidecar schema lets the user supplement UF mode with a `selected_addresses` list (concrete addresses kept exact). Stage 3.c's UF query needs to consult this list per memory and emit a `(select arr addr) == concrete_value` constraint for each selected address. The constraint encoding shape is straightforward; the open question is whether the constraint goes in the predicate-image query body or in a separate axiom set passed to the SMT solver.
3. **Multi-memory designs.** Caliptra mbox has ONE external SRAM. ibex regfile has ONE register file. Designs with N memory cells (e.g. a CPU with separate I-cache + D-cache) would have N Z3 array variables threaded through every step. Stage 3.c's `HashMap<Nid, Z3Term>` extension scales to this naturally, but the predicate-image SMT-query complexity scales O(N · cube_count) which may need explicit budget management.
4. **Reset semantics for UF arrays.** Today the bit-blaster handles `Init` by pinning state cells to their initial value at cycle 0. For UF arrays, the initial state of every address is undefined unless the sidecar declares an init policy (e.g. "all addresses init to 0"). Stage 3.c's lift either (a) treats every read at cycle 0 as nondeterministic (sound over-approximation), or (b) accepts a sidecar `init_value` for UF memories (more precise; needs schema extension). **Mitigation:** ship (a) in stage 3.c; defer (b) to a follow-up.
5. **State-cell width accounting.** `sum_widths` at [`bit_blast.rs:644`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/bit_blast.rs#L644) already skips array-sorted state cells, so the bit-blast cap-check ignores UF arrays. The predicate-cube lift's `max_cube_count` cap applies instead. **No accounting change required**; the existing array-skip logic in `sum_widths` is the right call.

## Effort budget (revised from precondition pass)

| Stage | Scope | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 3.b | Routing dispatch + stub `uf_lift_to_adapter_output` + integration test pinning the dispatch | ~3 days (1 session) |
| Stage 3.c | Z3 Array term construction in `kripke_smt` + `evaluate_pure` + `PredicateCubeLiftOptions::uf_memories` + 6-8 unit tests | ~1.5 wk (4-5 sessions) |
| Stage 4 | Bounded bit-blast mode (mode-3 reading: enumerate `selected_addresses` as a per-address state-cell ladder) | ~3 days |
| Stage 5 | Caliptra mbox vendoring + sidecar build + SBY oracle + verdict polarity comparison | ~5 days |

**Slot 4 revised total:** ~3.5 wk (was ~2.5 wk in the precondition pass; +1 wk for the more conservative stage 3.b/3.c decomposition).
