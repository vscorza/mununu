# External Tools

> Source of truth: [`adapter/yosys/mod.rs::locate_yosys`](../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/yosys/mod.rs#L979), [`adapter/yosys/mod.rs::locate_sv2v`](../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/yosys/mod.rs#L1027), [`adapter/cvc5/mod.rs::locate_cvc5`](../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/cvc5/mod.rs#L75) — surface: CLI+API

Mununu's verification engine, model checker, and synthesiser are pure Rust + the linked [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) library. Several pipelines also invoke external command-line tools via subprocess. Those tools are **optional** — mununu functions without them, and individual pipelines emit a structured `AdapterWarning` or `AdapterError` when invoked while a required tool is missing, never silently fail.

This document is the single canonical place describing each optional tool: what it does for mununu, how to install it on each supported platform, and which env var overrides the discovery path.

## Quick summary

| Tool | Required for | Install (macOS) | Install (Debian/Ubuntu) | Env var override |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Z3](#z3-required-linked-library) | Everything (linked at build time) | `brew install z3` | `apt install libz3-dev` | `LIBRARY_PATH` |
| [sv2v](#sv2v) | SystemVerilog preprocessing | `brew install zachjs-sv2v` | Build from [zachjs/sv2v](https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v) | `MUNUNU_SV2V_PATH` |
| [Yosys](#yosys) | SystemVerilog → BTOR2 pipeline | `brew install yosys` | `apt install yosys` | `MUNUNU_YOSYS_PATH` |
| [SymbiYosys (sby)](#sby--symbiyosys) | Verification oracle on RTL fixtures | Bundled with Yosys via OSS-CAD-Suite | Bundled with Yosys | `MUNUNU_SBY_PATH` |
| [CVC5](#cvc5) | Craig interpolation predicate source (`--predicate-source craig`) | `brew install cvc5` | `apt install cvc5` (Debian 12+ / Ubuntu 24.04+) | `MUNUNU_CVC5_PATH` |
| [Verilator](#verilator) | Reset-state simulation seeding (R-S2b, sidecar `simulate_reset`) | `brew install verilator` | `apt install verilator` | `MUNUNU_VERILATOR_PATH` |
| [circt-verilog](#circt-verilog) | Alternative extraction frontend (`mununu-extract circt`) | build CIRCT / release tarball | build CIRCT / release tarball | n/a (pipe input) |

Every **discovered** tool above (all but Z3, which is linked, and circt-verilog, which is a pipe-input producer) follows the same discovery pattern: the `MUNUNU_<TOOL>_PATH` env var is checked first; if absent, the bare binary name is invoked via `$PATH`. On a per-process basis — mununu does not cache discovery results across CLI invocations.

**Licensing posture (see [`deny.toml`](../deny.toml) + the `license-check` CI job).** Z3 is linked in-process (MIT — permissive, no contamination). Every other tool here is invoked as a **subprocess** (or, for circt-verilog, consumed as pipe input) — i.e. "mere aggregation", so its license (even Verilator's LGPL-3/Artistic-2) does **not** contaminate mununu's source license. None are bundled into a mununu artifact; contributors install them. The only license-contamination vector — the *linked* Cargo crate graph — is gated by `cargo deny check licenses` (deny-by-default permissive allow-list).

---

## Z3 (required, linked library)

> Source of truth: [`crates/mununu-core/Cargo.toml`](../crates/mununu-core/Cargo.toml#L57) — `z3 = "0.20"` — surface: build-time

Z3 is mununu's primary SMT backend, linked in-process via the `z3 = "0.20"` Rust crate. Unlike the other tools listed below, Z3 is **mandatory** — the workspace will not build without it.

### macOS
```bash
brew install z3
# The Rust crate's build script needs LIBRARY_PATH set:
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/z3/lib   # Intel
# or
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/z3/lib  # Apple Silicon
```

### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
apt install libz3-dev
```

The `docker/Dockerfile.dev` image installs `libz3-dev` automatically.

### Build-from-source
See the [upstream Z3 docs](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3#building-z3-from-source-using-cmake).

## sv2v

> Source of truth: [`adapter/yosys/mod.rs::locate_sv2v`](../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/yosys/mod.rs#L1027) — surface: CLI+API

sv2v lowers SystemVerilog-2017 constructs (interfaces, structs, `always_ff`, generates, parameterised modules) to a Verilog-2005 subset that Yosys can ingest. Preserves module hierarchy and signal names — load-bearing for mununu's per-module BTOR2 lift path.

Used by:
- The `mununu sv preprocess` CLI subcommand.
- The `--preprocessor sv2v` flag on the Yosys path (or `MUNUNU_USE_SV2V=1`).

### macOS
```bash
brew install zachjs-sv2v
```

### Debian / Ubuntu / others
No native package. Build from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v
cd sv2v && make
# Copy the produced `bin/sv2v` somewhere on $PATH, or set MUNUNU_SV2V_PATH.
```

### Discovery
1. `MUNUNU_SV2V_PATH` env var (explicit override).
2. `sv2v` on `$PATH`.

Missing-tool behaviour: `mununu sv preprocess` errors with an `UnsupportedConstruct` adapter error naming the install instructions. The Yosys path falls back to its native SV reader without sv2v normalisation; some SV-2017 constructs (generates, parameterised structs) won't elaborate.

---

## Yosys

> Source of truth: [`adapter/yosys/mod.rs::locate_yosys`](../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/yosys/mod.rs#L979) — surface: CLI+API

Yosys is the open-source synthesis suite mununu uses to lower elaborated Verilog into BTOR2 — the word-level intermediate representation the KMTS lifter consumes. Mininum supported version: **0.40**.

Used by:
- The SystemVerilog → BTOR2 pipeline (`adapter/yosys/`).
- Per-submodule emission (`write_btor <m>.btor`) without `flatten`, preserving module hierarchy.

### macOS
```bash
brew install yosys
# Yosys version: yosys --version
```

### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
apt install yosys
```

### OSS-CAD-Suite (cross-platform, includes sby)
The [OSS-CAD-Suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build) ships Yosys + sby + many other YosysHQ tools as a self-contained release tarball. Recommended when you need both Yosys and sby together.

### Discovery
1. `MUNUNU_YOSYS_PATH` env var (explicit override).
2. `yosys` on `$PATH`.

Missing-tool behaviour: the SV pipeline errors with an `UnsupportedConstruct` adapter error. Other mununu pipelines (CTXDSL, agentic, microcode) are unaffected.

---

## sby / SymbiYosys

> Source of truth: validation milestones M.0–M.4 — surface: contributor

[SymbiYosys](https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/) is the verification oracle mununu uses to cross-check verdicts on RTL fixtures (the M.0–M.4 milestones). Not invoked by any user-facing CLI command today — only by the milestone validation harness.

### Bundled installs
sby ships with the OSS-CAD-Suite tarball or via the `yosys-bin` Homebrew formula on macOS.

### macOS
```bash
brew install --HEAD symbiyosys
# or use the OSS-CAD-Suite tarball
```

### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
apt install yosys symbiyosys
```

### Discovery
1. `MUNUNU_SBY_PATH` env var (explicit override).
2. `sby` on `$PATH`.

Missing-tool behaviour: the milestone validation harness skips fixtures that require an SBY oracle; mununu's other pipelines are unaffected.

---

## CVC5

> Source of truth: [`adapter/cvc5/mod.rs::locate_cvc5`](../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/cvc5/mod.rs#L75) — surface: CLI+API

[CVC5](https://cvc5.github.io/) is an open-source SMT solver developed at Stanford + The University of Iowa, with strong support for SMT-LIB Craig interpolation via `(get-interpolant ...)`. Mununu uses it as a **second SMT backend** (alongside Z3) for the `PredicateSource::CraigInterpolation` path in the R.5 CEGAR loop.

CVC5 is invoked via subprocess (mirroring the sv2v / Yosys / SBY pattern); mununu does not link the `cvc5` / `cvc5-sys` Rust crates because they carry heavy build dep chains (GMP, CLN, antlr3-c).

Used by:
- The R.5 CEGAR loop when the predicate source is `Craig` (CLI: `--predicate-source craig`; sidecar: `cegar.predicate_source = "craig"`).
- Future Craig-based refinement paths (mununu's roadmap may extend CVC5 use to other refinement strategies).

### macOS
```bash
brew install cvc5
# Verify install: cvc5 --version
```

### Debian 12+ / Ubuntu 24.04+
```bash
apt install cvc5
```

### Older Debian / Ubuntu / others
The [cvc5 GitHub releases](https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5/releases) page provides pre-built Linux x86_64, macOS arm64+x86_64, and Windows binaries. Download the tarball, extract, and either copy `cvc5` to `/usr/local/bin/` or set `MUNUNU_CVC5_PATH` to the extracted binary.

### Build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5
cd cvc5
./configure.sh --auto-download
cd build && make -j
# The produced binary at build/bin/cvc5; copy to $PATH or set MUNUNU_CVC5_PATH.
```

### Discovery
1. `MUNUNU_CVC5_PATH` env var (explicit override).
2. `cvc5` on `$PATH`.

### Missing-tool behaviour

When `PredicateSource::CraigInterpolation` is selected (via CLI or sidecar) but CVC5 isn't found at runtime, mununu emits an `AdapterWarning` documenting the missing dep + the install instructions, then **falls back to the WeakestPrecondition heuristic** for the CEGAR run. The verification verdict is still computed; it just uses a less precise predicate-discovery mechanism. Other mununu pipelines that don't request Craig are unaffected.

### Version requirements

CVC5 ≥ 1.0 is required for the `(set-option :produce-interpolants true)` + `(get-interpolant ...)` syntax mununu uses. The Homebrew / apt packages ship versions ≥ 1.0 by default.

### Pattern B (deployment)

CVC5 is **not** installed by `docker/Dockerfile.dev`. Contributors install it locally per the instructions above. This mirrors the discipline already in place for sv2v / Yosys / SBY (all subprocess-only, all contributor-installed). The trade-off:

- Pro: CI doesn't pay the CVC5 build/install cost (~50MB image growth).
- Pro: Mininum Docker image stays small.
- Con: CI doesn't exercise the Craig path; the `#[ignore]`d integration tests stay ignored on CI. Contributors run them locally via `cargo test -- --ignored` after `brew install cvc5`.

When the Craig path becomes load-bearing for a milestone (e.g. V.3 speculative non-interference), a pattern-A follow-up will add CVC5 to `Dockerfile.dev` + remove the `#[ignore]`s. Tracked as sub-item 3.6 in the R-track multi-session breakdown — a deferred-with-trigger entry that fires when mununu opens a binary distribution channel (Homebrew formula / Debian package / Docker Hub image).

## Verilator

> Source of truth: [`adapter/verilator/mod.rs::locate_verilator`](../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/verilator/mod.rs#L79) — surface: CLI+API

[Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/) is an open-source SystemVerilog
simulator. Mununu invokes it via subprocess for **R-S2b reset-state simulation
seeding**: when a sidecar declares `simulate_reset`, mununu compiles + runs a short
concrete simulation through Verilator, captures the post-reset valuation of the
declared `observe_registers`, and feeds it to the bit-blaster's predicate seeder.

Verilator's own license (LGPL-3.0 / Artistic-2.0) does not affect mununu: it is run
as a separate process (mere aggregation) and is never bundled.

### macOS
```bash
brew install verilator
# Verify install: verilator --version
```

### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
apt install verilator
```

### Discovery
1. `MUNUNU_VERILATOR_PATH` env var (explicit override).
2. `verilator` on `$PATH`.

### Missing-tool behaviour
When a sidecar requests `simulate_reset` but Verilator isn't found, mununu falls back
gracefully to the other Phase-9 seeding strategies (BTOR2 `init` lines, etc.) — the
verdict is still computed, just without the simulation-derived seeds.

---

## circt-verilog

> Source of truth: [`mununu-extract/src/circt.rs`](../crates/mununu-extract/src/circt.rs) — surface: CLI (`mununu-extract circt`)

[`circt-verilog`](https://github.com/llvm/circt) (the CIRCT project's slang-based
Verilog frontend) lowers SystemVerilog to CIRCT MLIR. Unlike the discovered tools
above, mununu does **not** spawn it — it is a **pipe-input producer**: the user runs
circt-verilog and pipes its MLIR into the `mununu-extract circt` subcommand, which
parses the `hw`/`comb`/`seq` dialects into an explicit-state Kripke structure.

```bash
circt-verilog design.sv | mununu-extract circt --output spec.espec.json
```

This is an **alternative** extraction frontend (the primary RTL path is
sv2v → Yosys → BTOR2). Because it's pipe input, there is no `MUNUNU_*_PATH`
discovery and no in-mununu version check — the user supplies the MLIR. CIRCT is
Apache-2.0 (with the LLVM exception); as upstream tooling whose output mununu
consumes, it imposes no obligation on mununu.

> **Note (Track H / slang).** The SVA-verification front-end uses the standalone
> **`slang`** CLI (`slang --ast-json`) as a discovered subprocess (the cvc5 pattern),
> *not* circt-verilog — see the roadmap XL.0 decision. The `slang` adapter
> ([`adapter/slang/mod.rs::locate_slang`](../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/slang/mod.rs#L48)
> + the Tier-1 translator in `adapter/slang/translate.rs`) is shipped, but is not
> yet reachable from a user-facing surface — it is wired into a CLI/API/UI command
> by the Track-H endpoint (roadmap XL.6). A full `## slang` section with a
> `> Source of truth:` anchor lands here then (Documentation Traceability requires
> the anchor to be surface-reachable first).

---

## Verifying your install

After installing any of these tools, you can confirm mununu discovers them via:

```bash
# Z3 (linked; check via cargo)
cargo run -- --version

# sv2v
sv2v --version

# Yosys
yosys -V

# sby
sby --help

# CVC5
cvc5 --version

# Verilator
verilator --version
```

Mununu's discovery layer parses the version strings (or just confirms exit-zero) — there's no semver gating today, but each adapter's tests are pinned to versions known to work. If you hit a "binary not found" error from a mununu CLI subcommand, set the corresponding `MUNUNU_*_PATH` env var to the absolute path of the binary, or ensure it's on `$PATH`.
