## Safety Properties

Safety properties assert that "something bad never happens" - they are violated by finite execution traces.

### Pattern: Invariant (Always)

**LTL:** `G(φ)` - Globally, φ always holds  
**CTL:** `AG(φ)` - On all paths, globally φ holds

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Mutual Exclusion

**Context:** Two processes sharing a critical section in a synchronous round-based system.

**Property:** No two processes can be in the critical section simultaneously.

**LTL Formula:**
```
G(!(in_critical_section_1 && in_critical_section_2))
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(!(in_critical_section_1 && in_critical_section_2))
```

**Description:** In each synchronous round, at most one process can hold the critical section lock. This ensures mutual exclusion across all execution paths.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Bounded Buffer

**Context:** Producer-consumer system with a bounded buffer of size N.

**Property:** The buffer never exceeds its capacity.

**LTL Formula:**
```
G(buffer_count <= N)
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(buffer_count <= N)
```

**Description:** Regardless of the interleaving of producer and consumer actions, the buffer occupancy never exceeds N. This prevents buffer overflow in asynchronous message passing.

---

### Pattern: Response (Always Eventually)

**LTL:** `G(φ → F(ψ))` - If φ occurs, then eventually ψ will occur  
**CTL:** `AG(φ → AF(ψ))` - On all paths, if φ holds, then eventually ψ will hold on all paths

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Request-Response Protocol

**Context:** Client-server interaction in a synchronous request-response protocol.

**Property:** Every request is eventually followed by a response.

**LTL Formula:**
```
G(request → F(response))
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(request → AF(response))
```

**Description:** In a synchronous system where requests and responses occur in the same round or subsequent rounds, every request must eventually receive a response.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Message Delivery

**Context:** Asynchronous message passing system with unreliable channels.

**Property:** If a message is sent, it will eventually be delivered (assuming fair scheduling).

**LTL Formula:**
```
G(send_message → F(message_delivered))
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(send_message → AF(message_delivered))
```

**Description:** In an asynchronous system, messages may be delayed but must eventually be delivered under fair scheduling assumptions.

---

## Liveness Properties

Liveness properties assert that "something good eventually happens" - they cannot be violated by finite traces.

### Pattern: Eventually (Reachability)

**LTL:** `F(φ)` - Eventually φ will hold  
**CTL:** `EF(φ)` - There exists a path where eventually φ holds

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Termination

**Context:** Synchronous algorithm that must eventually terminate.

**Property:** The algorithm eventually reaches a terminal state.

**LTL Formula:**
```
F(terminated)
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
EF(terminated)
```

**Description:** In a synchronous system where all processes execute in lockstep, the algorithm must eventually reach a termination condition.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Progress

**Context:** Asynchronous distributed algorithm making progress toward a goal.

**Property:** The system eventually reaches a goal state.

**LTL Formula:**
```
F(goal_reached)
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
EF(goal_reached)
```

**Description:** Despite asynchronous execution and potential delays, the system must eventually reach the goal state.

---

### Pattern: Recurrence (Infinitely Often)

**LTL:** `GF(φ)` - Globally, eventually φ (infinitely often)  
**CTL:** `AG(AF(φ))` - On all paths, globally, eventually φ holds

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Fair Scheduling

**Context:** Round-robin scheduler in a synchronous system.

**Property:** Every process is scheduled infinitely often.

**LTL Formula:**
```
GF(process_1_scheduled) && GF(process_2_scheduled) && ... && GF(process_N_scheduled)
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(AF(process_1_scheduled)) && AG(AF(process_2_scheduled)) && ... && AG(AF(process_N_scheduled))
```

**Description:** In a synchronous system with a fair scheduler, every process must be given execution time infinitely often.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Heartbeat

**Context:** Distributed system with heartbeat messages.

**Property:** Heartbeat messages are sent infinitely often.

**LTL Formula:**
```
GF(heartbeat_sent)
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(AF(heartbeat_sent))
```

**Description:** In an asynchronous distributed system, heartbeat messages must be sent repeatedly to maintain liveness monitoring.

---

### Pattern: Strong Until

**LTL:** `φ U ψ` - φ holds until ψ holds (and ψ eventually holds)  
**CTL:** `A(φ U ψ)` - On all paths, φ holds until ψ holds

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Phase Transition

**Context:** Synchronous state machine with distinct phases.

**Property:** System remains in initialization phase until ready, then transitions to operational phase.

**LTL Formula:**
```
initialization U operational
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
A(initialization U operational)
```

**Description:** In a synchronous system, the initialization phase must persist until the system is ready, at which point it transitions to the operational phase.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Resource Reservation

**Context:** Asynchronous system with resource reservation protocol.

**Property:** Resource remains reserved until it is released or used.

**LTL Formula:**
```
resource_reserved U (resource_released || resource_used)
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
A(resource_reserved U (resource_released || resource_used))
```

**Description:** In an asynchronous system, once a resource is reserved, it must remain reserved until it is either explicitly released or used.

---

## Reactiveness Properties

Reactiveness combines safety and liveness: the system must continuously respond to environment inputs.

### Pattern: Request-Response (Reactivity)

**LTL:** `G(request → F(response))` - Always, if request then eventually response  
**CTL:** `AG(request → AF(response))` - On all paths, always, if request then eventually response

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Reactive Controller

**Context:** Synchronous reactive controller responding to sensor inputs.

**Property:** Every sensor reading triggers an eventual control action.

**LTL Formula:**
```
G(sensor_reading → F(control_action))
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(sensor_reading → AF(control_action))
```

**Description:** In a synchronous reactive system, every sensor input must eventually result in a control output, ensuring the system remains responsive.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Event Handler

**Context:** Asynchronous event-driven system.

**Property:** Every event is eventually processed by a handler.

**LTL Formula:**
```
G(event_occurred → F(event_handled))
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(event_occurred → AF(event_handled))
```

**Description:** In an asynchronous event-driven system, all events must eventually be processed, ensuring the system remains reactive to external stimuli.

---

### Pattern: Conditional Liveness

**LTL:** `G(φ → GF(ψ))` - Always, if φ then infinitely often ψ  
**CTL:** `AG(φ → AG(AF(ψ)))` - On all paths, always, if φ then always eventually ψ

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Periodic Task

**Context:** Synchronous system with periodic task execution.

**Property:** If a task is enabled, it executes infinitely often.

**LTL Formula:**
```
G(task_enabled → GF(task_executed))
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(task_enabled → AG(AF(task_executed)))
```

**Description:** In a synchronous system, enabled tasks must execute repeatedly, ensuring periodic behavior.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Fair Resource Access

**Context:** Asynchronous system with shared resources.

**Property:** If a process requests a resource, it eventually gets access infinitely often (under fairness).

**LTL Formula:**
```
G(resource_requested → GF(resource_granted))
```

**CTL Formula:**
```
AG(resource_requested → AG(AF(resource_granted)))
```

**Description:** In an asynchronous system with fair scheduling, resource requests must be granted repeatedly.

## GR(1) Patterns

GR(1) (Generalized Reactivity of rank 1) is a fragment of LTL that is efficiently realizable. It has the form:

```
(φ^e_1 ∧ ... ∧ φ^e_m) → (φ^s_1 ∧ ... ∧ φ^s_n)
```

Where:
- **Environment assumptions** (φ^e_i): Safety (G) and justice (GF) properties
- **System guarantees** (φ^s_i): Safety (G) and justice (GF) properties

### Pattern: Basic GR(1) Template

**Structure:**
```
(⋀ᵢ G(env_assumption_i) ∧ ⋀ⱼ GF(env_justice_j)) 
→ 
(⋀ₖ G(system_guarantee_k) ∧ ⋀ₗ GF(system_justice_l))
```

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Mutual Exclusion with Fairness

**Context:** Two processes competing for a shared resource in a synchronous system.

**Environment Assumptions:**
- Safety: Process requests are mutually exclusive in each round
- Justice: Each process requests the resource infinitely often

**System Guarantees:**
- Safety: Only one process holds the resource at a time
- Justice: Each process gets the resource infinitely often

**GR(1) Formula:**
```
(G(!(request_1 && request_2)) ∧ GF(request_1) ∧ GF(request_2))
→
(G(!(grant_1 && grant_2)) ∧ GF(grant_1) ∧ GF(grant_2))
```

**Description:** In a synchronous system, if the environment ensures mutually exclusive requests and each process requests infinitely often, then the system guarantees mutual exclusion and fair resource allocation.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Producer-Consumer with Bounded Buffer

**Context:** Asynchronous producer-consumer system with bounded buffer.

**Environment Assumptions:**
- Safety: Producer doesn't produce when buffer is full
- Justice: Producer produces infinitely often
- Justice: Consumer consumes infinitely often

**System Guarantees:**
- Safety: Buffer never overflows (buffer_count <= N)
- Safety: Consumer doesn't consume from empty buffer
- Justice: Produced items are eventually consumed

**GR(1) Formula:**
```
(G(buffer_full → !produce) ∧ GF(produce) ∧ GF(consume))
→
(G(buffer_count <= N) ∧ G(buffer_empty → !consume) ∧ GF(consume))
```

**Description:** In an asynchronous system, if the environment respects buffer capacity and both producer and consumer act infinitely often, the system guarantees bounded buffer operation and eventual consumption.

---

### Pattern: Conditional GR(1)

**Structure:** GR(1) with conditional guarantees based on environment state.

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Conditional Service

**Context:** Synchronous service that responds conditionally to requests.

**Environment Assumptions:**
- Safety: Requests are valid (valid_request)
- Justice: Valid requests occur infinitely often

**System Guarantees:**
- Safety: Service only responds to valid requests
- Justice: Valid requests are eventually serviced

**GR(1) Formula:**
```
(G(valid_request) ∧ GF(valid_request))
→
(G(service_response → valid_request) ∧ GF(service_response))
```

**Description:** In a synchronous system, if the environment only sends valid requests infinitely often, the system guarantees responses only to valid requests and eventually services all valid requests.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Adaptive Rate Control

**Context:** Asynchronous system with adaptive rate control based on load.

**Environment Assumptions:**
- Safety: Load signals are consistent
- Justice: High load occurs infinitely often
- Justice: Low load occurs infinitely often

**System Guarantees:**
- Safety: Rate is reduced when high load is detected
- Safety: Rate is increased when low load is detected
- Justice: System adapts to load changes

**GR(1) Formula:**
```
(G(load_signal_consistent) ∧ GF(high_load) ∧ GF(low_load))
→
(G(high_load → rate_reduced) ∧ G(low_load → rate_increased) ∧ GF(rate_adjusted))
```

**Description:** In an asynchronous system, if the environment provides consistent load signals and both high and low load occur infinitely often, the system adapts its rate accordingly.

---

## Counter Strategies for GR(1)

When a GR(1) property is unrealizable, counter strategies show how the environment can force the system to violate its guarantees.

### Pattern: Environment Counter Strategy

**Structure:** A strategy for the environment that demonstrates unrealizability by showing how environment assumptions can be satisfied while preventing system guarantees.

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - Unrealizable Mutual Exclusion

**Context:** Two processes with conflicting requirements in a synchronous system.

**Problem:** System cannot guarantee mutual exclusion if both processes always request simultaneously.

**Counter Strategy:**
- Environment always sets `request_1 = true` and `request_2 = true` in every round
- System must grant to at least one process (by liveness)
- But granting to both violates mutual exclusion (safety)
- System cannot satisfy both safety and liveness

**GR(1) Formula (Unrealizable):**
```
(G(true) ∧ GF(request_1) ∧ GF(request_2))
→
(G(!(grant_1 && grant_2)) ∧ GF(grant_1) ∧ GF(grant_2))
```

**Counter Strategy Description:**
1. Environment always enables both requests
2. System must eventually grant to process 1 (justice)
3. System must eventually grant to process 2 (justice)
4. But system cannot grant to both simultaneously (safety violation)

**Fix:** Add environment assumption: `G(!(request_1 && request_2))` - requests are mutually exclusive.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Unrealizable Bounded Buffer

**Context:** Producer-consumer with insufficient buffer capacity.

**Problem:** System cannot guarantee bounded buffer if producer rate exceeds consumer rate.

**Counter Strategy:**
- Environment always enables production (GF(produce))
- Environment never enables consumption (violates GF(consume) assumption)
- System must accept all productions (by liveness)
- Buffer eventually overflows (safety violation)

**GR(1) Formula (Unrealizable):**
```
(GF(produce) ∧ G(!consume))
→
(G(buffer_count <= N) ∧ GF(consume))
```

**Counter Strategy Description:**
1. Environment produces infinitely often
2. Environment never consumes (violates assumption, but shows what happens)
3. System must accept productions (justice)
4. Buffer grows unbounded (safety violation)

**Fix:** Ensure environment assumption includes `GF(consume)` - consumer must act infinitely often.

---

### Pattern: System Counter Strategy

**Structure:** A strategy showing how the system can violate guarantees even when environment assumptions hold.

#### Use Case 1: Synchronous System - System Deadlock

**Context:** Synchronous system that can deadlock.

**Problem:** System can enter a state where no progress is possible.

**Counter Strategy:**
- Environment satisfies all assumptions
- System enters deadlock state where no transitions are enabled
- System cannot satisfy liveness guarantees

**GR(1) Formula (Unrealizable):**
```
(G(env_assumption) ∧ GF(env_justice))
→
(G(system_safety) ∧ GF(system_justice))
```

**Counter Strategy Description:**
1. Environment maintains assumptions
2. System reaches deadlock state
3. System cannot make progress (violates GF(system_justice))
4. System is stuck forever

**Fix:** Add system guarantee: `G(EF(progress))` - system can always make progress.

#### Use Case 2: Asynchronous System - Unfair Scheduling

**Context:** Asynchronous system with unfair scheduler.

**Problem:** System can starve some processes indefinitely.

**Counter Strategy:**
- Environment satisfies assumptions
- System scheduler always favors process A
- Process B is never scheduled
- System violates fairness guarantee

**GR(1) Formula (Unrealizable):**
```
(G(env_assumption) ∧ GF(env_justice))
→
(G(system_safety) ∧ GF(process_A_scheduled) ∧ GF(process_B_scheduled))
```

**Counter Strategy Description:**
1. Environment maintains assumptions
2. System always schedules process A
3. Process B is never scheduled (violates GF(process_B_scheduled))
4. System violates fairness

**Fix:** Implement fair scheduling algorithm or add stronger fairness guarantees.

## Notes on Synchronous vs Asynchronous Systems

### Synchronous Systems
- **Characteristics:** All processes execute in lockstep, global clock, deterministic interleaving
- **Pattern Usage:** Properties often relate to round-based execution, phase transitions, and deterministic scheduling
- **Verification:** Easier to verify due to deterministic execution paths

### Asynchronous Systems
- **Characteristics:** Independent process execution, no global clock, non-deterministic interleaving
- **Pattern Usage:** Properties often relate to message passing, fairness, and eventual consistency
- **Verification:** More complex due to interleaving, often requires fairness assumptions

## Appendix: Common Formula Patterns

### Safety Patterns
```ltl
G(!bad_state)                    // Never reach bad state
G(φ → X(ψ))                      // If φ then next ψ
G(φ → (ψ W χ))                   // If φ then ψ until χ
```

### Liveness Patterns
```ltl
F(goal_state)                     // Eventually reach goal
GF(φ)                             // Infinitely often φ
G(φ → F(ψ))                       // Always, if φ then eventually ψ
```

### Reactiveness Patterns
```ltl
G(request → F(response))          // Request-response
G(φ → GF(ψ))                      // Conditional recurrence
G(φ → (ψ U χ))                    // Conditional until
```
