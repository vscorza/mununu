# API schemas — verdict + verify-auto response

Mununu's verify surfaces (CLI, HTTP API, UI) all speak one verdict vocabulary. This document pins down the JSON wire format for the `sv verify-auto` response — the shape downstream tools should code against.

## PropertyVerdict — the four canonical outcomes

Every verify surface reports one of four values as a lowercase string. Wire format:

| Value | Semantics |
|-------|-----------|
| `"holds"` | The property holds on every reachable state / path — a sound proof. Definite. |
| `"violated"` | The property is violated — a real counterexample exists. Definite. |
| `"unknown"` | No engine decided within budget: abstention, over-cap, timeout, or a soundness alarm (contradiction between engines). Definite in intent — never a hidden `Holds`/`Violated`. |
| `"skipped"` | The property was not evaluated: out of the supported fragment, refused by the engine's soundness guard (input-derived antecedent, partial-write havoc, etc.), or filtered pre-run. |

Rust source: [`PropertyVerdict`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/verdict.rs#L22) — `as_str()` at line 155 is the canonical mapping.

**Never treat `skipped` or `unknown` as `holds` in a CI gate.** The default `--fail-on violated` treats both as pass; `--fail-on none` treats both as fail. Choose the polarity your gate actually wants.

## SvVerifyAutoResponse — top-level shape

Rust source: [`SvVerifyAutoResponse`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/api/models.rs#L1691).

```jsonc
{
  "properties": [ /* PropertyVerdictView[] — see below */ ],
  "unsupported": [ /* UnsupportedAssertionView[] — SVA outside the fragment */ ],
  "diagnostics": {
    "state_register_count": 42,
    "blackboxed_modules":   ["some_missing_module"],
    "gated_resets":         ["rst_n=1"],
    "auto_provided_stubs":  ["prim_sparse_fsm_flop"]
  },
  "notes": [ /* VerificationNoteView[] — provenance/scope/soundness notes */ ]
}
```

## PropertyVerdictView — per-property

Rust source: [`PropertyVerdictView`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/api/models.rs#L1743).

```jsonc
{
  "name":               "my_assertion",
  "kind":               "assert",              // "assert" | "assume" | "cover"
  "formula":            "nu X. ((!req || [] grant) && [] X)",  // mu-calc lift of the SVA
  "outcome":            "holds",               // canonical PropertyVerdict as-string
  "detail":             "cube: 0 false / 12 unknown", // optional; skip reason, cell counts
  "seeded_predicates":  ["req == 1", "grant == 1"],   // atoms auto-seeded for this property
  "counterexample":     null                   // present only for exact-symbolic Violated on AF-shape
}
```

**Field-by-field:**

- `name` — SVA label from the source (`assert property (foo) …` → `"foo"` when labelled).
- `kind` — `"assert"` / `"assume"` / `"cover"`.
- `formula` — the mu-calc string the engine actually evaluated. Round-trip-parseable via `mu_calculus::parser::parse`.
- `outcome` — one of the four canonical `PropertyVerdict` values. This is the field to gate on.
- `detail` — human-facing extra: `"cube: <false> false / <unknown> unknown"` for cube verdicts; `"skip-<reason>"` for skips (see the skip-reason catalog below). Optional.
- `seeded_predicates` — the abstraction-cube atom strings seeded for this property. Empty for engines that don't use a cube.
- `counterexample` — see [Counterexample](#counterexample--cexcellview--counterexampleview) below. Only present for `Violated` on bare `AF p` / `AG EF p` / `AG AF p` decided by the exact-symbolic engine; `null`/absent otherwise.

## Counterexample — CexCellView / CounterexampleView

Rust source: [`CounterexampleView`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/api/models.rs#L1763) + [`CexCellView`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/api/models.rs#L1777).

Two shapes co-exist in one field:

**(1) Stall-lasso / trap-path** — for liveness/recoverability failures. Reset → `prefix` → repeating `cycle`; each state is an ordered list of register cells.

```jsonc
{
  "prefix": [
    [ { "register": "st_q",     "value": 0 }, { "register": "cnt_q", "value": 0 } ],
    [ { "register": "st_q",     "value": 1 }, { "register": "cnt_q", "value": 1 } ]
  ],
  "cycle": [
    [ { "register": "st_q",     "value": 3 }, { "register": "cnt_q", "value": 5 } ]
  ]
}
```

**(2) Unreachable-target witness** — for a `Violated` bare `EF p` (reachability). The target atoms are simply never reached from reset; no state trace.

```jsonc
{
  "prefix": [],
  "cycle":  [],
  "unreachable_target": ["st_q == 7", "err_q == 1"]
}
```

`unreachable_target` is omitted (or empty) for shape (1). `prefix`/`cycle` are empty for shape (2). Consumers should treat either `unreachable_target.length > 0` or `cycle.length > 0` as valid — never both non-empty.

## Model diagnostics + notes

**`diagnostics`** — one object per response:

- `state_register_count` — total state register lines in the lifted BTOR2.
- `blackboxed_modules` — modules instantiated with no body (cut to free inputs). A non-empty list often explains a `skipped` verdict.
- `gated_resets` — reset inputs the run pinned inactive at model level (`"<signal>=<value>"`), with their `disable iff` guards dropped from the formulas.
- `auto_provided_stubs` — cut flop primitives (e.g. `prim_sparse_fsm_flop`) for which a behavioural stub was auto-injected so the register survives the lift.

**`notes`** — provenance / scope / soundness paragraph objects. Each has:

- `kind` — kebab-case category, e.g. `"config-concretization"`, `"antecedent-shadow"`, `"parameter-override"`, `"control-slice"`, `"lift-frontend"`.
- `level` — `"info"` | `"scope-caveat"` | `"soundness-caveat"`.
- `summary` — one-line human line.
- `detail` — longer explanation of the why + implication.
- `items` — structured operands (e.g. `["cfg_detect_timer_i=7"]`).

Every verdict-modifying decision (config pin, parameter override, cut point, reset gating, antecedent shadow, etc.) is echoed in `notes`, so verdict provenance is explicit.

## Unsupported assertions

Rust source: [`UnsupportedAssertionView`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/api/models.rs#L1551). One entry per SVA that could not be translated:

```jsonc
{ "name": "some_property", "kind": "assert", "reason": "unbounded ##[m:$] delay in sequence antecedent" }
```

Unsupported assertions are **surfaced honestly**, never silently dropped. Reasons are terse; the SVA fragment is documented at [`docs/verifying-rtl.md`](../verifying-rtl.md).

## DiscoveredAssumption — refinement-lane fields

`sv verify-auto` doesn't emit `holds_under` today — that field is populated by the recoverability verb's `--discover-assumptions` flow (see [`crates/mununu-core/src/verdict.rs`](../../crates/mununu-core/src/verdict.rs#L142)). Documented here for completeness because both fields share the `PropertyVerdict` vocabulary:

```jsonc
{
  "phi":         "GF(en == 1)",             // human-readable predicate over named inputs
  "kind":        "input_fairness",          // input_hold | input_conjunction | input_schedule
                                            // reset_eventually | env_strategy
                                            // input_fairness | input_fairness_conjunction
  "non_vacuous": true,                      // gate: does `good` actually get reached under phi?
  "engine":      "exact-symbolic per-cell"  // provenance
}
```

**Critical semantic:** a discovered assumption is a **CONDITIONAL** result. The canonical `PropertyVerdict` remains `unknown` even when a non-vacuous `phi` is found. Consumers must not read `holds_under.length > 0` as "the property holds"; it means "the property would hold under `phi`, and we still don't know unconditionally."

## Stability contract

- **`PropertyVerdict` values** (`"holds"` / `"violated"` / `"unknown"` / `"skipped"`) are **stable**. Adding a new variant would be a breaking change and requires a policy-mandated consumer briefing.
- **`SvVerifyAutoResponse` field shape** is **additive-evolving**: new optional fields land as `#[serde(default)]` (no consumer action required); renaming or removing a field requires a briefing.
- **`PropertyVerdictView` field shape** is **additive-evolving**. Same additive rule.
- **`kind` values on `VerificationNoteView`** are **evolving**: new categories land regularly (each landing carries a note-kind description in a briefing); consumers must treat unknown `kind` as informational (do not error on unknown kinds).
- **`level` values on `VerificationNoteView`** are **stable**: `"info"` | `"scope-caveat"` | `"soundness-caveat"`.
- **`AssumptionKind` values** are **evolving-adding** (each new variant lands with a briefing). Serialized as `snake_case`.
- **Counterexample two-shape polymorphism** (stall-lasso vs unreachable-target) is **stable**: `prefix`/`cycle` for lasso, `unreachable_target` for reachability.

Anything under `notes[].detail` or `notes[].summary` is human-facing prose — **do not string-match against it**. Use `notes[].kind` + `notes[].items` for structured signals.

## Consumer guidance

**For a CI gate**, the minimal parse is:

```js
const bad = report.properties.filter(p => p.outcome === "violated");
process.exitCode = bad.length > 0 ? 2 : 0;
```

Or with the mununu-native semantic — treat both `violated` and `unknown` as failures unless you know you're OK with unknowns:

```js
const bad = report.properties.filter(p => p.outcome === "violated" || p.outcome === "unknown");
```

**For a differential oracle** across two mununu invocations (e.g. shadow-synth on/off): compare `properties[i].outcome` per property. Verdicts that flip between `holds` and `violated` are a soundness alarm; verdicts that gain a definite value from `unknown`/`skipped` are precision gains.

**For a downstream that ingests a stream of verdicts:** always guard against unknown `kind`/`level`/enum values with a default branch. mununu's stability contract permits additive expansion; consumers that error on unknown enums will fail-open on the additive cases.

**For version pinning:** the `Cargo.toml` version is not currently a semantic-version stability commitment. Every downstream that depends on the wire format should either:
- Pin a specific mununu binary version and refresh on a schedule, OR
- Subscribe to consumer briefings under [`../consumer-briefings/`](../consumer-briefings/) and adopt each briefing on its own cadence.

**For error handling:** an HTTP 400 from the API means the request itself was rejected (malformed source, bad flag value); the response body is a `{ "error": string }` shape, not `SvVerifyAutoResponse`. An HTTP 500 means an unexpected engine failure; retry with the same input is usually safe.
