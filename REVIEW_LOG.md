# mununu Hand-Review Log

Companion to `~/.claude/plans/i-am-looking-the-declarative-snowflake.md`.
Append-only. One H2 section per chapter. Roll up `bug`-severity findings at the end when all chapters are `done`.

## Conventions

### Severity vocabulary (fixed)

- **`bug`** — incorrect behaviour, soundness violation, or contract breach. For `arch`-category findings, `bug` means *the codebase violates a stated architectural contract* (e.g. an adapter reaches into another adapter; a summary endpoint runs synthesis). Must be filed as a follow-up before the chapter can be marked `done` (architecture `bug`s block Ch 17A, not the chapter where they were found).
- **`concern`** — design / clarity / documentation issue that would block a new contributor; not blocking for the review itself.
- **`note`** — observation, "huh interesting", possible future cleanup.

### Category vocabulary (fixed)

- **`behavior`** — code does the wrong thing (or a non-obvious right thing worth documenting). Fix near where found.
- **`arch`** — decomposition / layering / dependency-direction / primitive-choice issue. Do *not* fix mid-review; accumulate evidence and decide in Chapter 17A.
- **`doc`** — drift between documentation and code (anchor for `/docs-traceability`). Often a quick fix; sometimes signals an `arch` issue underneath.

### Finding ID format

`CC-FNN` where `CC` is the chapter number (zero-padded, `00`–`17`, or `1A` / `17A` / `11a`–`11f` for letter-suffixed chapters) and `NN` is sequential within the chapter. Examples: `02-F01`, `11a-F03`, `17A-F02`.

### Status vocabulary

- Chapter status: `not started` → `in-progress` → `blocked` | `done`
- Finding status: `open` → `triaged` → `fixed in <sha>` | `wontfix (<reason>)` | `RFC <link>` (for `arch` findings deferred to 17A)

## Chapter 2 — CLTS Data Model `[SENSITIVE]`

Started:
Reviewer:
Status: not started

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehension Q: why is `MustHyperOnly` boxed and other variants not?
- [ ] Comprehension Q: what does it mean for a CLTS to have *no* `state_valuation` for a given state?
- [ ] Smoke test: `cargo test -p mununu-core clts::`
- [ ] Smoke test: `cargo test -p mununu-core --test r3_kleene_baseline`
- [ ] **I2.1**: no adapter / lifter constructs `TransitionModality::MustHyperOnly(_)` (only `composition::*` does) — `rg "MustHyperOnly\(" crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/` returns nothing surprising
- [ ] **I2.2**: `must ⊆ may` invariant — no constructor produces "must without may"
- [ ] **I2.3**: `LabelControllability` never encoded as label-name suffix (`_ctrl_`, `_unctrl_`, `_env_` grep returns only test fixtures)
- [ ] **I2.4**: multi-label edges built as one transition (spot-check `adapter::aiger`)
- [ ] **I2.5**: `Tristate::KleeneBot` only demoted to definite verdict via documented paths
- [ ] **AQ2.1** answered in §Architecture Q&A
- [ ] **AQ2.2** answered in §Architecture Q&A
- [ ] **AQ2.3** answered in §Architecture Q&A
- [ ] **AQ2.4** answered in §Architecture Q&A

### Findings
| ID | Severity | Category | Anchor | Description | Status |
|----|----------|----------|--------|-------------|--------|

### Architecture Q&A
- **AQ2.1 — Module boundary**: Should `Tristate` and `TransitionModality` live inside `clts/mod.rs`, or be promoted to a sibling `kmts/` module?
  - Answer:
  - Evidence:
  - Action:
- **AQ2.2 — Primitive overlap**: Do `state_variable_bitset`, `state_valuation`, and `state_3valued_predicates` represent three views of the same information, or three distinct facts?
  - Answer:
  - Evidence:
  - Action:
- **AQ2.3 — Type-level vs comment-level invariants**: Could `must ⊆ may` be enforced by construction (private fields, smart constructors) rather than by absence-of-constructor?
  - Answer:
  - Evidence:
  - Action:
- **AQ2.4 — `IdStorage` genericity**: Is parameterising every CLTS over `S: IdStorage` paying for itself, or is everyone using `DefaultStateIdx`?

- [ ] Smoke test: `cargo test -p mununu-core --test r3_kleene_baseline`
- [ ] Smoke test: `mununu context eval examples/counters/counters.ctxdsl --sidecar examples/counters/counters_properties.ctxdsl --formula reachability --automaton Counter`
- [ ] **I4.1**: fixpoint inversion rule — `¬(μX. φ) → νX. ¬φ`, body's `X` references NOT negated; confirm with witness test
- [ ] **I4.2**: witness/strategy extraction returns lasso traces (prefix + cycle); cycle non-empty for liveness witnesses, prefix may be empty
- [ ] **I4.3**: `evaluate_tri` never silently collapses `KleeneBot`; every demotion commented
- [ ] **I4.4**: `evaluate` over sharp-everywhere KMTS = identical results to 2-valued evaluator (semantic regression)
- [ ] **AQ4.1** answered in §Architecture Q&A
- [ ] **AQ4.2** answered in §Architecture Q&A

- [ ] **I6.1**: shared alphabet synchronises, independent labels interleave (CSP rule); confirm with 2x2 hand example
- [ ] **I6.2**: `Internal` controllability mutually-exclusive between automata in composition; confirm composition test where one side has `Internal a` and the other `Controllable a`
- [ ] **I6.3**: `TransitionModality::MustHyperOnly` placeholder from `merge` IS realized in composition layer; grep for `merge_with_hyper_targets`

  - Answer:
  - Evidence:
  - Action:

### Per-adapter acceptance criteria (applies to every subsection)
- [ ] Parse a real example without error
- [ ] Emitted CTXDSL canonicalises losslessly (parse → emit → parse → equal)
- [ ] Multi-label edges are *one* transition where source format has multi-action (Ch 2 I2.4)

- [ ] Smoke test: `cargo test -p mununu-core --test sv_preprocess_sweep`
- [ ] Smoke test: `mununu sv discover examples/systemverilog/alu.sv`
- [ ] **I11a.1** (sensitive): BTOR2 KMTS lifter never emits `MustHyperOnly`
- [ ] **I11a.2**: every cross-module register read annotated as `KleeneBot` until sidecar resolves

### 11b — AIGER / TLSF
- [ ] Smoke test: `mununu context eval examples/aiger/alarm.aag --formula safety_alarm_on --automaton Circuit`

### 11c — Promela
- [ ] Smoke test: `mununu context eval examples/promela/mutex_simple.pml --formula mutex --automaton System`

### 11d — Agentic (xstate / crewai / langgraph)

### 11e — Extraction (.espec.json → CTXDSL)
- [ ] Smoke test: `mununu context import examples/ast_extract/<one>/*.espec.json`
- [ ] Walk both directions: `mununu-extract` (producer) and `adapter::extraction` (consumer)

- [ ] Smoke test: `cargo test -p mununu-core contract::`
- [ ] Smoke test: `mununu contract validate <example>`
