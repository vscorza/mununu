//! Canonical property-verdict vocabulary — the single source of truth for the
//! verdict string every verify surface reports.
//!
//! Model checking answers a property with one of four outcomes. Historically each
//! surface spelled them differently — `holds`/`violated`/`unknown` on the flagship
//! `sv verify-auto` and extraction, but `reachable`/`unreachable`/`contradiction` on
//! `btor2 verify` and `inconclusive` on `btor2 verify-liveness`. [`PropertyVerdict`]
//! fixes ONE spelling and every surface maps its engine-specific verdict into it via
//! the `From` impls here, so the surfaces cannot drift.
//!
//! The vocabulary is the one the flagship already uses: `holds` / `violated` /
//! `unknown` / `skipped`. Surface-specific *detail* (which engines decided, a
//! soundness-contradiction alarm, cube-cell counts) stays in the surface's own
//! response fields alongside this canonical verdict.
