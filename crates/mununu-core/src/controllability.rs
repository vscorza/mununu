//! Shared controllability classifier — task A4 of
//! `docs/design/black-box-modules.md`.
//!
//! The rule, restated from Document A §4:
//!
//! > The controllability of a transition label is the controllability of
//! > whichever side of the boundary drives it.
//!
//! In practice this collapses to: classify labels by the direction of the
//! driving port at the *current scope's boundary*. Inputs (driven by the
//! environment) become `Uncontrollable`; outputs (driven by the module
//! the surrounding logic owns) become `Controllable`; signals that do
//! not cross the boundary are `Internal`.
//!
//! Today's pipelines each compute the classification differently because
//! they receive different inputs:
//!
//! - **Custom SV** has port directions per module — uses this helper
//!   directly. The same `BoundaryDirection` enum applies.
//! - **BTOR2** loses port-direction information through yosys's
//!   `flatten`; falls back to "all uncontrollable" plus a CLI override
//!   list. The unification recommendation (Document B §B.3) is to preserve
//!   the original port directions and feed them through this helper.
//!   Until that lands, the BTOR2 path keeps the CLI list as an escape
//!   hatch.
//! - **Software extraction** has no native notion of port direction;
//!   domain profiles approximate it with method-name globs. Those globs
//!   are a domain-specific approximation of this rule — they should be
//!   read as "is this method called from outside or inside the
//!   component's boundary?"
//!
//! The shared helper in this module is the canonical answer; the three
//! adapter callers funnel through it when they have direction info.
