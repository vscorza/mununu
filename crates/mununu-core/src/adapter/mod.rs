//! Format adapter subsystem — translates external specification formats
//! into CTXDSL text via a shared intermediate representation.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Source file → Format Parser → Format AST → to_ir() → AdapterIR → emit() → CTXDSL text
//! ```
//!
//! Each adapter implements the [`FormatAdapter`] trait. The shared IR types
//! live in [`ir`], and the CTXDSL emitter in [`emit`].
//!
//! # Soundness Checklist for Adapter Implementors
//!
//! Every adapter must address the following before being considered complete:
//!
//! 1. **Unsupported constructs must warn.** Any source-language construct that
//!    is skipped or partially handled must emit an [`AdapterWarning`] with
//!    [`WarningKind::UnsupportedConstruct`] and note the soundness impact
//!    (over-approx or under-approx).
//!
//! 2. **State abstraction direction must be documented.** For every field or
//!    register abstracted into a finite domain, document whether the abstraction
//!    is an over-approximation (admits more behaviors) or under-approximation
//!    (admits fewer behaviors) using `// SOUNDNESS:` comments.
//!
//! 3. **Guard evaluation failures must be documented.** When `eval_expr` or
//!    guard evaluation returns `None`/default, document whether the fallback
//!    is conservative (over-approx: allows transition) or optimistic
//!    (under-approx: blocks transition).
//!
//! 4. **Controllability must be explicit.** Every label must have a clear
//!    rationale for its controllability classification. If heuristic-based,
//!    emit [`WarningKind::NeutralControllability`] so the user can override.
//!
//! 5. **Known-verdict regression test must exist.** At minimum one test with a
//!    known-safe and one known-unsafe property, verifying the adapter produces
//!    a model that gives the expected verdict.
