//! R.5 — CEGAR refinement loop MVP for BTOR2 + predicate-cube lift +
//! 3-valued parity-game evaluator.
//!
//! Per the §Phase 5 + §Phase 6 + §10.1 R.5 entries of the KMTS plan
//! (`.claude/plans/you-are-a-formal-vast-lake.md`), this module ships
//! the **API surface** for the failure-subgame-driven CEGAR loop.
//! The load-bearing predicate-discovery mechanisms (Craig interpolation
//! and weakest-precondition computation) are 4-week scopes that are
//! deferred to a follow-up; this MVP delivers the smallest shippable
//! shape that:
//!
//! 1. Closes the API surface: `CegarOptions`, `CegarTrace`,
//!    `CegarIteration`, `CegarTermination`, `PredicateSource`,
//!    `cegar_refine_loop()`.
//! 2. Wires the iteration loop: `predicate_cube_lift` (R.2.5) →
//!    `evaluate_3v_game` (R.5.0) → check for KleeneBot → predicate-
//!    discovery callback → repeat until convergence or cap-hit.
//! 3. Implements bounded refinement (default 16 iterations) with
//!    soundness-tagged warning on cap-hit.
//! 4. Satisfies the §10.1 R.5 binary done-criterion: a hand-curated
//!    fixture where the initial predicate set returns `KleeneBot`
//!    closes in ≤ 3 iterations when the caller supplies the right
//!    refinement predicate via [`PredicateSource::Manual`].
//!
//! **What this MVP does NOT do** (flagged via the `predicate_source`
//! variant and the `lazy_lift_pending` / `approximant_reuse_enabled`
//! flags on `CegarTrace`):
//!
//! - **WP is a heuristic, not full weakest-precondition.** The
//!   `WeakestPrecondition` source ships an MVP that emits
//!   separating predicates over state registers not yet in the
//!   predicate set, capped at 2 per call. It does NOT perform
//!   symbolic back-substitution along the classifying transition;
//!   that's queued as an R.5 follow-up. The name "WP" describes
//!   the API contract (an alternative to `Manual` and
//!   `CraigInterpolation`), not the formal weakest-precondition
//!   construction.
//! - **No Craig interpolation.** The `CraigInterpolation` source
//!   short-circuits to empty (requires Z3 with interpolation
//!   support; queued).
//! - **No lazy KMTS construction.** Each iteration re-runs
//!   `predicate_cube_lift` over the full predicate set; `KmtsLiftLazy`
//!   is a R.5 follow-up.
//! - **No real approximant reuse.** The MVP re-evaluates from scratch
//!   each iteration. The `game_position_evaluations` counter is
//!   instrumented so the R.5 follow-up's improvement is measurable
//!   against this baseline.
//! - **No SMT lemma cache** (§Phase 6 §6.4 R-F3). Pure
//!   non-amortised re-check.
//!
//! Consumers that need the full CEGAR fidelity must wait for R.5
//! follow-ups. The `predicate_source` enum's variants + the
//! `lazy_lift_pending` / `approximant_reuse_enabled = false` flags
//! on `CegarTrace` are the explicit handshakes between R.5 MVP and
//! the future load-bearing implementation.
