//! XL.3b — BTOR2 `__past` shadow shift-register synthesis (Tier-2 SVA history).
//!
//! The slang translator (XL.3a) lowers `$past`/`$stable`/`$changed`/`$rose`/
//! `$fell` to atoms over shadow signals `<base>__past`, `<base>__past2`, … and
//! reports the needed base signals — with the deepest history depth each — in
//! [`crate::adapter::slang::translate::TranslationReport::required_shadows`].
//! This module is the model half of that contract: it augments the BTOR2 design
//! with a `depth`-stage shift register per base so those atoms bind.
//!
//! For each base `b` at depth `k`, resolving to a state cell **or a primary
//! input** of sort `S`, the augmentation appends a `k`-stage chain (with fresh
//! NIDs above the current max):
//!
//! ```text
//! <s1> state <S> b__past                ; b, one cycle ago
//! <n1> next  <S> <s1> <b_nid>           ; next(b__past)  = b
//! <s2> state <S> b__past2               ; b, two cycles ago
//! <n2> next  <S> <s2> <s1>              ; next(b__past2) = b__past
//! …                                     ; up to b__past{k}
//! <i>  init  <S> <sj> <b_init_value>    ; each stage — see below
//! ```
//!
//! `next(b__pastⱼ) = b__past(ⱼ₋₁)` (stage 1 samples `b`) makes `b__pastⱼ` hold
//! `b`'s value `j` cycles ago at every cycle ≥ `j`. Each stage's `init` mirrors
//! `b`'s own reset value, so before the chain has filled (cycles `< j` for stage
//! `j`) `$past(b, j)` reads that reset value — the standard "no history before
//! the first clock edges" convention, generalised from 1 cycle to `k`. Depth 1
//! keeps the historical bare `b__past` name (backward compatible).
//!
//! A **primary input** base has no reset value to mirror, so every stage is
//! pinned to an explicit zero (see the SOUNDNESS note in
//! [`augment_with_past_shadows`] for why zero, not free). It matters in practice
//! — `$past` of an input is what every data-integrity property is written over:
//!
//! ```systemverilog
//! (push && !pop && cnt_q == 0) |=> (d0_q == $past(din))
//! ```
//!
//! Restricting the base to state cells made that whole class unverifiable: the
//! translator declared `required __past shadow registers: din(8)`, nothing built
//! `din__past`, and every engine then correctly reported
//! `predicate references unknown register/signal`. The restriction was
//! conservative rather than semantic — `next` sourced from an `input` node is
//! well-formed BTOR2 and the engines consume it unchanged.
//! This is **exact** (a real added flop, not an abstraction): the augmented
//! design *is* the concrete system the verdict transfers to.
//!
//! This works at the BTOR2 **text** level (append lines) so it composes with
//! [`crate::adapter::btor2::kmts_lift::predicate_cube_lift`] /
//! [`crate::adapter::btor2::bit_blast`], both of which re-parse the text.
