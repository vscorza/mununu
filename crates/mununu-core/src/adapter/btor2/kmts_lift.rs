//! R.2 — BTOR2 → KMTS lifter.
//!
//! Per the KMTS architecture
//! (`docs/design/native-sv-abstraction.md` §6, §7;
//! `docs/design/kmts-theory.md` §6;
//! `docs/design/predicate-abstraction-recipe.md` §2),
//! this module promotes the existing 2-valued
//! [`Btor2Adapter`](super::Btor2Adapter) output into a KMTS-aware
//! shape consumable by the post-R.3 `KleeneDomain` evaluator.
//!
//! **R.2 scope (MVP).** The lifter is a *post-hoc enrichment* over
//! the existing BTOR2 adapter — it does not change the CLTS shape
//! today, it adds a parallel `predicate_labellings` side-map keyed
//! by `(automaton, state, predicate_name) → Tristate`. Each entry
//! is derived from the BTOR2 bit-blaster's per-state register
//! valuations: every `(register, value)` pair becomes a predicate
//! `<register>=<value>` whose `KleeneT` set is the states where the
//! register has that value, and whose `KleeneF` set is every other
//! enumerated state. **No `KleeneBot` values are produced at R.2** —
//! the bit-blaster's explicit-state enumeration is exact, so every
//! predicate has a definite verdict at every state.
//!
//! Modality is also uniform at R.2: every transition the bit-blaster
//! emits has both a may-witness (the abstraction admits the edge)
//! and a must-witness (the bit-blaster's exact enumeration computes
//! the concrete reachability), so every edge is `Sharp`. This
//! matches the legacy semantics exactly; the R.2 lifter produces a
//! KMTS that is *vacuously* 3-valued — the same verdicts as the
//! 2-valued evaluator on every fixture today.
//!
//! **Where R.2 stops being a no-op.** When R.5 (CEGAR) + R.5b (UF
//! abstraction) land, the lifter's predicate-image construction
//! will introduce `KleeneBot` valuations (predicates the abstraction
//! cannot decide) and `MayOnly` transitions (over-approximation
//! edges from UF-abstracted operators). The R.2 surface is the
//! interface those phases plug into; today it ships the enrichment
//! shape and a fixture-sweep regression so the post-R.3 evaluator
//! has something to read.
//!
//! ## Predicate-cube lift architecture (U.1–U.4 unification, 2026-06-26)
//!
//! The predicate-cube path (the R.2.5+ cap-bypassing lift; distinct from
//! the R.2 post-hoc enrichment above) has **one** public entry and one
//! shared per-cube body, after the lift-unification refactor:
//!
//! - [`lift_predicate_cube`] — the single gated entry the CEGAR loop +
//!   verify orchestrator call. Runs the compound soundness gate
//!   ([`ensure_compound_lift_supported`]) once, then dispatches on
//!   [`LiftStrategy`](crate::adapter::btor2::cegar::LiftStrategy):
//!   `Eager` → [`predicate_cube_lift`], `Lazy` → [`LazyLift`] +
//!   [`materialize_clts_from_lazy`].
//! - [`cube_sampling_edges`] — the ONE per-cube sampling body (canonical
//!   representative → input-combo enumeration → UF-rep simulate →
//!   predicate re-evaluation → target cube), shared by the eager
//!   sampling loop + the lazy [`compute_cube_outgoing_edges`]. Returns
//!   `(target, LabelDescriptor)` pairs deduped by `(target, descriptor)`,
//!   which reproduces both effective edge sets. **The eager and lazy
//!   sampling lifts cannot diverge** — the
//!   `u1_eager_lazy_differential_equivalence` test asserts they produce
//!   byte-identical CLTSes.
//! - [`apply_sampled_must_inference`] — the ONE sampled-target must-edge
//!   post-pass (`SmtPerTarget{,Standard}` / `SmtHyperMust`; the ∀∃ and
//!   hyper passes route through the STS-IR seam), shared by both paths.
//!
//! **Strategy matrix.** The may-relation has two shapes:
//! - `MayEdgeInference::SmtAllPairs` — sound global all-pairs SMT
//!   may-relation. **Eager-only** (a global Z3 query, not a per-cube
//!   one) and the **only** path that honours compound predicates (via
//!   the `SmtEncode` seam + `PredicateLike::expr`).
//! - `MayEdgeInference::Off` (sampling) — the per-cube
//!   [`cube_sampling_edges`] body; simple `register==value` atoms only.
//!   Runs on both Eager + Lazy and is the eager≡lazy equivalence corpus.
//!
//! **Compound rule.** Compound predicates (`compound_exprs`) require
//! `Eager` + `SmtAllPairs`: the sampling representative inverse can't
//! realise e.g. `a==0 && b==0`, and the lazy body never consults
//! `compound_exprs`. [`ensure_compound_lift_supported`] enforces this at
//! the entry (and via thin defensive copies in `predicate_cube_lift` +
//! `LazyLift::from_btor2` for the ~39 direct callers).

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// R.2.5 — predicate-cube lift API
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per the §Phase 5 R.2.5 / §Phase 6 §6.3 / §10.1 plan entries, the R.2
// post-hoc lifter inherits the bit-blaster's `MAX_STATE_BITS = 20` cap.
// R.2.5 ships an alternative API whose abstract states are predicate
// cubes (2^|P|), bypassing the bit-blast enumeration entirely.
//
// **R.2.5 MVP scope** (this commit): the API surface, structural
// state-space construction (2^|P| cubes as `Clts` states with the
// matching `state_3valued_predicates` labelling), the binary capability
// test (a synthetic BTOR2 fixture with > MAX_STATE_BITS total state
// bits but |P| ≤ 10 lifts where R.2 errors), and an explicit
// `predicate_image_pending` flag marking the structural debt that the
// load-bearing SMT-driven must/may edge construction (R.5 / R.5b) will
// close.
//
// **What this MVP does NOT do**: no SMT predicate-image queries; no
// must-edges; no may-edges (the returned Clts has the cube state set
// but no transitions). Verdicts computed over the R.2.5 output today
// are useless (every property evaluates over an isolated set of cube
// states with no dynamics), but the *binary capability* — lifting a
// cap-exceeding fixture into a predicate-cube state space — is real
// and verifiable. The done-criterion in §10.1 R.2.5 is explicitly
// binary; verdict correctness lands when R.5's `KmtsLiftLazy` ships.

/// R.5 lazy KMTS sub-item 2.4 (2026-06-04) — materialize a
/// fully-formed `PredicateCubeLiftResult` from a `LazyLift` by
/// visiting every cube in 0..cube_count and emitting one
/// `Transition::MayOnly` per `LazyExpansionEdge`. Identity result
/// with `predicate_cube_lift` (sub-item 2.3's
/// `r5_subitem_23_lazy_lift_edges_match_eager_lift` test
/// asserts the per-cube edge sets agree).
///
/// **Purpose**: bridge for the CEGAR loop's `LiftStrategy::Lazy`
/// path (sub-item 2.4) — until the evaluator gains lazy-handle
/// support, the loop still needs a full `Clts` to call
/// `evaluate_3v_game_with_options`. This helper visits every
/// cube (defeating the laziness payoff for the CEGAR run) but
/// exercises the `LazyLift` machinery end-to-end, surfacing
/// any drift between the lazy + eager per-cube paths as a
/// verdict-equality test failure.
///
/// **Memory caveat**: visiting every cube populates the
/// `LazyLift`'s cache fully (cached_count() == cube_count()
/// after this call). The lazy memory savings only fire when
/// the caller visits a strict subset of cubes — which is what
/// sub-item 2.5's bench fixture will exercise standalone (not
/// via the CEGAR loop).
/// §Phase 10 stage 3.c.2a (2026-06-12) — encode a BTOR2 file for the
/// must-edge SMT post-passes, selecting the theory by whether the
/// design carries memory cells.
///
/// - No array-sorted state cells → `Theory::BvOnly` (pure QF_BV;
///   the pre-stage-3.c.2a behaviour, unchanged for every memory-
///   free fixture).
/// - One or more array-sorted state cells → `Theory::BvUfArray`
///   (QF_AUFBV), so the encoder's stage-3.c.1 `select`/`store`
///   handling produces an array-aware transition relation. This is
///   the **must-side** of the §Phase 10 havoc-may / array-must
///   composition: the must-edge query reasons about memory
///   precisely via Z3 array theory.
///
/// The cube predicates the must-edge query asserts are over BV
/// registers only (memory cells are not in `view.signals`), so the
/// query construction in `smt_must_edge.rs` is unchanged — it just
/// consumes a richer transition relation.
// P0 (IR-unification track) — `pub(crate)` so the STS-IR seam

// theory) rather than via the BvOnly `encode_design`, matching the
