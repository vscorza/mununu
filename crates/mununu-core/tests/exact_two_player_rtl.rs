//! P2.5-F — the exact two-player game engine (`exact_two_player_verdict`) validated on REAL RTL: the
//! OpenTitan `edn_main_sm` boot handshake and `otbn_start_stop_control`, the same verbatim-extracted
//! fixtures the 1-player recoverability work uses. Here they are viewed as genuine TWO-PLAYER games by
//! partitioning their primary inputs into controller-owned vs environment-owned.
//!
//! The industrial reading: the software-programmed MODE/REQUEST signals (`boot_req_mode_i`,
//! `edn_enable_i`, `start_i`) are the CONTROLLER's; the acknowledge / error / escalation signals coming
//! from OTHER modules (`csrng_cmd_ack_i`, `local_escalate_i`, `urnd_reseed_ack_i`, …) are the
//! ENVIRONMENT's. Two hand-verifiable results, on real designs:
//!
//! 1. **Reduction check (all inputs controllable).** With every input the controller's, the controllable
//!    predecessor collapses to the single-agent diamond (`∀∅ ∃all = ∃all`), so `<(ctrl=controllable)>`
//!    ≡ `<>` and the two-player verdict must equal the 1-player reachability verdict. This cross-checks
//!    `cpre_controllable` against the already-validated `diamond_pre` on real RTL.
//!
//! 2. **The genuine two-player finding (mode controllable, acks environment).** Driving the mode signals
//!    is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT: the environment can withhold the acknowledge (`csrng_cmd_ack_i` /
//!    `urnd_reseed_ack_i`) forever, or escalate — so the controller CANNOT force the handshake to
//!    complete. The verdict flips to VIOLATED. This is exactly the motivation for an assume-guarantee
//!    ENVIRONMENT ASSUMPTION ("the acknowledging module eventually acks"): realizability of the handshake
//!    holds only under such an assumption. The flip HOLDS→VIOLATED between (1) and (2), driven purely by
//!    moving the acks from the controller to the environment, is the industrial validation of the game.
