//! Regression: a `$past` over a primary INPUT must be DECIDED, not skipped.
//!
//! The data-integrity shape — "what was pushed is what got stored" —
//! is written `push |=> d0_q == $past(din)`, and `din` is a module input.
//! Until the `resolve_shadow_source` fix, the BTOR2 shadow synthesiser only
//! accepted a base that resolved to a *state cell*, so `din__past` never got a
//! flop and every property of this shape came back `Skipped`. That is the worst
//! kind of gap: the run is green and nothing was checked.
//!
//! Two things are asserted here that a unit test on `augment_with_past_shadows`
//! structurally cannot:
//!
//!   1. the fix is REACHABLE — `verify_auto` pre-filters the shadow bases before
//!      calling the augmenter, and for a while that filter still asked
//!      `resolve_state_by_symbol`, dropping input bases before they arrived. The
//!      unit tests passed the whole time because they call the augmenter
//!      directly. Only a test through `verify_auto` sees the filter.
//!   2. the property is REAL — a contrast twin with the capture corrupted must
//!      come back `Violated`. A property that cannot be made to fail is not
//!      being checked (the same two-sided gate the recoverability examples use).
//!
//! Two pre-existing defects were found while writing this and are NOT addressed
//! here — both reproduce identically on a REGISTER-sourced `$past`, so neither is
//! introduced by input support, and both look like one root cause: an appended
//! shadow flop breaking the KMTS `must ⊑ may` containment.
//!
//!   * `symbolic_engine: true` over any `$past` model panics at
//!     `mu_calculus/symbolic.rs:179`, "TritBdd invariant must ⊑ may".
//!   * `must_edge_inference: SmtPerTarget` reports `Violated` for a CORRECT
//!     design carrying a `$past` property — a false positive. A property with no
//!     `$past` is unaffected in both postures.
//!
//! Docker-gated (`mununu-sva`): needs slang + yosys. Run with `--ignored`.
