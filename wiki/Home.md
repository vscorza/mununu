# Mununu

> **Alpha Software** — Mununu is under active development. APIs, syntax, and behavior may change. We welcome feedback and bug reports via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vscorza/mununu/issues).

Mununu is a formal verification tool for reactive systems modeled as **Compositional Labeled Transition Systems (CLTS)**. It helps hardware verification engineers and system designers verify protocols, synthesize controllers, and check temporal properties -- all from a single, readable DSL.

Whether you are designing a handshake protocol, an arbiter, a multi-clock-domain pipeline, a sensor network, or an **agentic AI orchestration workflow**, Mununu lets you model the system, compose its parts, state the properties you care about, and get a definitive answer: does the property hold, and if so, can a controller enforce it?

## Key Capabilities

- **CTXDSL** -- a purpose-built DSL for defining automata, alphabets, compositions, formulas, and controllers in one file.
- **Mu-calculus and LTL** -- express safety, liveness, reachability, and fairness properties using mu-calculus directly or via LTL sugar.
- **Synchronous and asynchronous composition** -- combine automata lock-step (shared clock) or interleaved (independent clocks), with hierarchical nesting for cross-domain designs.
- **Controller synthesis** -- automatically derive a maximally permissive controller that enforces a given property, respecting the controllable/uncontrollable label split.
- **Counterstrategy generation** -- when a property is unrealizable, Mununu produces diagnostic traces showing how the environment can force a violation.
- **Format adapters** -- import specifications from XState/Statecharts, SystemVerilog RTL, TLSF, AIGER, Promela, **CrewAI**, and **LangGraph**, plus extraction-spec inputs from C / Rust / TypeScript. Export synthesized controllers back to XState JSON or SystemVerilog modules.
- **N-source verify framework** -- a `verify.toml` manifest composes any combination of the above sources, picks an alphabet-binding strategy, declares a composition shape, and ships a structured `VerifyReport` from CLI / HTTP API / web UI.
- **Web UI** -- the companion `mununu-ui` frontend connects to the built-in API server for interactive graph visualization, formula evaluation, and synthesis. Supports importing adapter formats directly from the file picker.
