# Controller Synthesis

> **Alpha Software** — Mununu is under active development. APIs, syntax, and behavior may change. We welcome feedback and bug reports via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vscorza/mununu/issues).

## What is Controller Synthesis?

Controller synthesis answers the question: **"Can we automatically build a controller that enforces a given property, no matter what the environment does?"** Instead of manually designing a state machine and then verifying it, you describe the plant (the system to be controlled), declare which actions are under your control, specify the desired property, and let Mununu compute a controller that is correct by construction.

For hardware designers, this is analogous to automatic logic synthesis from temporal specifications -- but at the protocol and control-flow level. You describe the allowable behaviors of your bus arbiter, handshake protocol, or state machine, and Mununu computes the most permissive controller that satisfies your safety or liveness requirements.

## Controllable vs. Uncontrollable Actions

Mununu follows the **Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control** framework. Every action (label) in the system is classified as either:

- **Controllable**: actions the system/controller can choose to enable or disable. These represent outputs, actuator commands, and decisions the designer controls. Examples: motor commands, grant signals, valve open/close.
- **Uncontrollable**: actions the environment triggers and the controller cannot prevent. These represent inputs, sensor events, and external stimuli. Examples: sensor readings, client requests, fault signals.

The key invariant: **the controller can only restrict controllable actions.** Uncontrollable actions always pass through -- if the environment can trigger a transition, the controller cannot block it. A valid controller must tolerate every possible uncontrollable event while ensuring the property holds.

## CTXDSL Syntax

### Declaring Controllable Actions

Inside an automaton block, the `controllable` section lists labels under the controller's authority. All other labels in the alphabet are implicitly uncontrollable:

```
automaton RobotArm {
    controllable {
        label extend;
        label retract;
        label grip;
        label release;
    }
    // object_detected, obstacle_detected, idle are uncontrollable
    ...
}
```

### Declaring a Controller

Controllers are declared in the `controllers` block. Each controller references a source automaton and a formula it must satisfy:

```
controllers {
    controller safe_robot {
        source RobotArm;
        satisfying safety_invariant;
    }
}
```

### Controller Options

Controllers support optional configuration for minimization and diagnostics:

```
controllers {
    controller impossible_valve {
        source Valve;
        satisfying impossible_spec;
        minimize = true;
        diagnostics {
            counterexample = true;
            deadlock_traces = true;
        }
    }
}
```

## Realizability

A specification is **realizable** when there exists a controller strategy that satisfies the property for all possible environment behaviors. A specification is **unrealizable** when no such controller exists -- the environment has a winning counterstrategy that forces the property to be violated.

Realizability depends on three factors:
1. The structure of the plant (states and transitions)
2. The controllability partition (which actions the controller owns)
3. The property formula (what must be satisfied)

### When a Controller Exists

A controller exists when the initial state(s) of the automaton fall within the **winning region** -- the set of states from which the controller has a strategy to enforce the property indefinitely. Mununu computes this winning region using mu-calculus fixpoint evaluation with game semantics.

### When a Controller Does Not Exist

Synthesis fails when the initial state lies outside the winning region. This means the environment can force a violation from the start. Mununu reports this as unrealizable and can optionally provide diagnostic information (counterexamples and deadlock traces) to help understand why.

## Example: Robot Arm (Tutorial 06)

The robot arm has controllable actuators and uncontrollable sensors:

```
context robot_arm {
    alphabet {
        label extend; label retract; label grip; label release;
        label object_detected; label obstacle_detected; label idle;
    }

    automata {
        automaton RobotArm {
            controllable {
                label extend; label retract;
                label grip;   label release;
            }

            states {
                state Home initial;
                state Extended; state Gripping;
                state Retracting; state Blocked;
            }

            transitions {
                transition Home -> Extended on label extend;
                transition Extended -> Gripping on label grip;
                transition Gripping -> Retracting on label retract;
                transition Retracting -> Home on label release;
                transition Extended -> Gripping on label object_detected;
                transition Extended -> Blocked on label obstacle_detected;
                transition Blocked -> Home on label retract;
                transition Home -> Home on label idle;
                transition Extended -> Extended on label idle;
            }
        }
    }

    mu_formulas {
        formula safety_invariant {
            over RobotArm;
            body = nu X. ([] X);
        }

        formula ctrl_return_home {
            over RobotArm;
            body = mu X. (Home || [ (ctrl = controllable) ] X);
        }
    }

    controllers {
        controller safe_robot {
            source RobotArm;
            satisfying safety_invariant;
        }
    }
}
```

The `safety_invariant` formula (`nu X. ([] X)`) is realizable -- the controller can keep the system in valid states. The `ctrl_return_home` formula uses game semantics: `[ (ctrl = controllable) ] X` means all uncontrollable transitions must stay in the winning region AND at least one controllable transition must progress toward `Home`.

**Synthesis output** (via CLI):

```bash
mununu context synth tutorial/examples/06_controllability.ctxdsl \
    --formula safety_invariant --automaton RobotArm
```

The controller restricts reachable states to the winning region while allowing all safe controllable actions.

## Unrealizable Example: Impossible Valve (Tutorial 09)

When a specification is physically impossible, synthesis reports unrealizability:

```
context unrealizable_valve {
    automata {
        automaton Valve {
            controllable { label open_valve; label close_valve; }
            states { state Closed initial; state Open; }
            transitions {
                transition Closed -> Open on label open_valve;
                transition Open -> Closed on label close_valve;
                transition Closed -> Closed on label pressure_drop;
                transition Open -> Open on label pressure_rise;
            }
        }
    }

    mu_formulas {
        formula impossible_spec {
            over Valve;
            body = Open && Closed;
        }
    }

    controllers {
        controller impossible_valve {
            source Valve;
            satisfying impossible_spec;
            diagnostics {
                counterexample = true;
                deadlock_traces = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

No state can satisfy `Open && Closed` simultaneously -- the formula evaluates to the empty set. The winning region is empty, so the controller is unrealizable from any initial state. With `diagnostics` enabled, Mununu reports counterexample traces showing that the environment wins from every state.

## GR(1) Fix: Fairness Assumptions

When a simple liveness property is unrealizable because the environment can stall, adding **fairness assumptions** in GR(1) form can make it realizable. The GR(1) pattern is:

```
GF(assumption) -> GF(guarantee)
```

In mu-calculus, this becomes:

```
(! (nu X. (mu Y. (assumption || <> Y)) && ([] X)))
    || (nu Z. (mu W. (guarantee || <> W)) && ([] Z))
```

**Example: AMBA Bus Arbiter** -- If client 0 requests infinitely often (fairness assumption), it must be granted infinitely often (liveness guarantee):

```
formula grant0_reachable {
    over bus_system;
    body = (! (nu X. (mu Y. (Requesting0 || <> Y)) && ([] X)))
        || (nu Z. (mu W. (Grant0 || <> W)) && ([] Z));
}
```

This says: if the environment is fair (GF Requesting0), then the system must be fair in response (GF Grant0). Without the fairness assumption, the environment could starve a client by never requesting, making the guarantee vacuously impossible to verify.

## Controller Minimization

When `minimize = true` is set (either in CTXDSL or via `--minimize` on the CLI), Mununu applies bisimulation reduction to the synthesized controller. This produces the smallest controller with equivalent behavior, which is useful for:

- Reducing implementation complexity in hardware
- Generating more readable controller automata
- Comparing controllers structurally

```
controllers {
    controller minimal_arbiter {
        source Arbiter;
        satisfying safety_invariant;
        minimize = true;
    }
}
```

## Diagnostics

When synthesis fails (unrealizable), diagnostics help you understand why:

| Option | CLI Flag | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `counterexample = true` | `--counterexample` | Generate counterstrategy traces showing how the environment forces violation |
| `deadlock_traces = true` | `--deadlock-traces` | Capture traces that lead to deadlock states (no outgoing transitions in the controller) |

```bash
mununu context synth spec.ctxdsl \
    --formula impossible_spec --automaton Valve \
    --counterexample --deadlock-traces
```

## Known Limitations

### Strategy vs Projection

Current controllers are **projections** of the winning region — they retain all transitions between winning states. For safety properties, this IS a valid strategy (any move within the region preserves the invariant). For liveness/GR(1), the controller may include transitions that don't guarantee progress.

Use `--extract-strategy` to produce a **positional strategy** that keeps only ONE controllable transition per state:

```bash
mununu context synth example.ctxdsl --formula F --automaton A --extract-strategy
```

### GR(1) Obligation Tracking

Mununu evaluates GR(1) formulas as nested mu-calculus fixpoints, which correctly computes the winning region. However, it does **not** implement the Piterman-Pnueli-Sa'ar rank-based algorithm that tracks which obligation is being pursued. This means:

- The winning region is correct
- But the synthesized controller does not cycle through obligations (g₁ → g₂ → ... → gₘ → repeat)
- For `[]<> g₁ && []<> g₂`, the controller knows WHICH states are winning but not HOW to schedule visits

This is planned for a future release via instrumented fixpoint evaluation (Bruse, Friedmann & Lange, 2016).

### Lasso Traces

Counterexample traces for liveness properties now include **lasso format**:

```
lasso trace #0: Red -> (PedWaiting)^ω
```

The prefix shows the path to the cycle entry, and the cycle repeats infinitely. Use `--counterexample` with synthesis to see lasso traces.
