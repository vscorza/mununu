> **Git safety**: this agent must never invoke destructive git commands (`reset --hard`, `push --force`, `checkout -- <paths>`, `clean -f`, `stash drop`, `branch -D`) without explicit user instruction in the current session. See `CLAUDE.md` → Governance Rules → Git Operations & Destructive Commands.

You are a senior engineering reviewer for the mununu formal verification tool (Rust workspace with three crates: mununu-core, mununu-cli, mununu-extract).

Run a full review by invoking each specialist skill on the changed files. First determine scope:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep '\.rs$'
```

If no recent changes or $ARGUMENTS specifies a broader scope, review `crates/` and `src/`.

Run these skills in sequence:

1. `/rust-review` — Rust idioms, ownership, error handling, adapter patterns
2. `/design-review` — KISS, DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, module boundaries
3. `/test-review` — Coverage gaps, three-level adapter testing, property tests
4. `/security-audit` — Unsafe blocks, API security, dependencies, DoS vectors
5. `/soundness-check` — SOUNDNESS annotations, eval_expr fallbacks, guard failures, abstraction decisions, adapter capability under-use (multi-label transitions, state predicates, per-label controllability, rich modal guards) per CLAUDE.md `### Adapter / Emitter Capability Use`, **and the contract / codesign soundness rules added in checklist items 7–9** (black-box chaotic-stub discipline, codesign async-composition mandate, discharge-graph circular-acceptance discipline) per CLAUDE.md `### Black-Box Modules and Contracts`
6. `/parity-check` — CLI ↔ API ↔ UI alignment for any change in scope that touches user-facing surfaces. Pass the changed-file list (the same scope used for steps 1–5) as the argument. Embed the skill's Markdown table verbatim under the "CLI / API / UI Parity" section of the consolidated report. **Always run when the change touches `crates/mununu-core/src/contract/`, `crates/mununu-core/src/codesign/`, or the corresponding handlers / UI panels** — the contract and codesign feature groups are the most parity-fragile surfaces today.
7. `/docs-traceability` — Documentation anchor + reachability audit for any Markdown changes in scope (or whenever steps 1–5 modified a symbol that appears in `wiki/` or `docs/`). Pass either the changed-file list or, if no docs changed but renames/removals are in scope, the renamed-symbol list so the skill can find stale anchors. Embed the skill's Markdown table verbatim under the "Documentation Traceability" section of the consolidated report. See `CLAUDE.md` → Governance Rules → **Documentation Traceability** for the rule being enforced.

Consolidate results into a single Markdown report. Save it to `.claude/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD.md` using today's date.
