# validate.sh — R46-6 / GAP-2: per-cluster slicing × param-concretization
# COMPOSE. This is the synthetic proof the GAP-2 de-risk called for, and
# the regression guard for the composed path.
#
# Contract, in two checks:
#   1. WITHOUT the sidecar the design is REJECTED (72 raw state bits) —
#      proving per-cluster slicing ALONE cannot rescue it: each cluster's
#      cone is still a 24-bit counter past MAX_STATE_BITS = 20.
#   2. WITH the sidecar (`bounded_counter bound=127` per counter), automatic
#      per-cluster verification fires (joint effective = 3 × 7 = 21 > 20),
#      slices each counter into its own cluster, and the concretization
#      shrinks that counter to 7 effective bits so the cluster fits. All
#      three reachability properties come back SATISFIED + non-vacuous,
#      each routed to a distinct cluster automaton (`Circuit__clK`).
#
# Like the R46-5 fixture, the BTOR2 is produced in mununu's own temp dir,
# so nothing cap-busting lands under examples/ where the
# btor2_kmts_lift_sweep glob would trip on it.
