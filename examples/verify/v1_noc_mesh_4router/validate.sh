# validate.sh — V.1 4-router NoC liveness (progress vs contention). §Phase 7
# domain validation; controlling doc docs/design/industrial-value-and-validation-domains.md §4.
#
# For each scheduling discipline:
#   1. Re-generate into a tmp dir and diff against the checked-in progress/
#      contention/ (the generator is deterministic).
#   2. Run `mununu verify` and assert the verdicts:
#        deadlock_freedom      = true  (both)
#        liveness_possible     = true  (both — AG EF delivered)
#        hop_bound             = true  (both — hops never exceed the diameter)
#        delivered_at_diameter = true  (both — delivered at exactly 2 hops)
#        liveness_inevitable   = true  under progress / false under contention
#      The last is the discriminating verdict: strong inevitability (AF) holds
#      only when the scheduler is fair; an unfair stall path starves the flit.
#
# The model is a generated design-pattern demonstration of the NoC-liveness
# domain, NOT a finding about a real interconnect (claims-integrity). The
# single-flit abstract `wait` over-approximates contention from other flows;
# the liveness verdicts are reported under exactly that reading.
