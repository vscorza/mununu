# validate.sh — R46-6 / GAP-2 regression: a WIDE field concretized to a
# small value set fits the cap (effective-bits accounting) AND its
# escape-to-OOB no longer reports a spurious VIOLATED (realize
# numericity-gate fix).
#
# Contract, in three checks:
#   1. WITHOUT the sidecar, `wide7.sv`'s 24-bit `cnt` is REJECTED
#      (StateSpaceOverflow: 24 > MAX_STATE_BITS = 20) — proving the raw
#      design does not fit and the concretization is load-bearing.
#   2. WITH the sidecar (`bounded_counter bound=7` → 3 effective bits),
#      the design lifts: the effective-bits cap accounting (GAP-2) admits
#      it where raw width did not.
#   3. The two reachability properties target in-set, genuinely-reachable
#      values (cnt == 1, cnt == 7) and come back SATISFIED + non-vacuous.
#      Before the realize OOB-marker fix the escape-to-OOB at 7→8 produced
#      an OOB sink whose `__mununu_oob__` valuation tripped the numericity
#      gate, disabling atom binding and reporting a spurious VIOLATED.
#
# Like the R46-5 fixture, the BTOR2 is produced in mununu's own temp dir
# (the yosys adapter), so nothing cap-busting lands under examples/ where
# the `btor2_kmts_lift_sweep` glob would trip on it. This script writes
# only its own report JSON, to a mktemp dir.
