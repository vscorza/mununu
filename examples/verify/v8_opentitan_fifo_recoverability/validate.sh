# validate.sh — V.8 recoverability showcase on OpenTitan prim_fifo_sync_cnt.
#
# Asks a branching-time question SVA cannot state, over a datapath RELATION:
#     "from every reachable fill level, can the FIFO always drain back to EMPTY?"
# Empty is not a control-FSM state — it is the relation `wptr == rptr` over the two
# wrap-pointer counters (prim_fifo_sync_cnt.sv line 63: `empty_o = wptr_wrap_cnt_q ==
# rptr_wrap_cnt_q`). So the recoverability target is RELATIONAL:
#     always_recoverable = nu Y. ((mu X. (empty || <> X)) && [] Y)   (AG EF empty)
# with empty = (wptr_wrap_cnt_q == rptr_wrap_cnt_q) — a `REG == REG` target, decided
# by the compound-good machinery (frontier b), not a `REG == VALUE` control atom.
#
# HONEST RESULT (this is the interesting part, not a bug):
#   * Small FIFO (exact engine, <= ~40 bits of pointer state): AG EF empty HOLDS —
#     from any fill level empty is reachable (drain). Definite-TRUE.
#   * Wide FIFO (beyond the exact cap, 2^21 entries = 22-bit wrap pointers): the drain to
#     empty needs the read pointer to PROGRESS up to the write pointer — a well-founded
#     descent over two INDEPENDENT counters (the RANKING class), which no bounded predicate
#     set captures, so the predicate cube alone ABSTAINS. mununu's RANKING CERTIFICATE
#     decides it anyway: over the EXACT transition it proves that from every non-empty state
#     SOME input (a read) strictly decreases the ranking δ = wptr - rptr, which — δ bounded
#     below — forces a descent to empty (Podelski-Rybalchenko, ∃-input variant, one relation,
#     no 2^|P|). So AG EF empty decides HOLDS at 2^21 depth in ~0.1s where exact BDD walls.
#     Contrast: the ALL-PATH variant fails here (writing keeps δ non-decreasing), which is
#     correct — the FIFO is AG EF empty but NOT AG AF empty (the env may write forever).
#
# Pedigree: prim_fifo_sync_cnt.sv + prim_count_pkg.sv are real OpenTitan RTL
# (Apache-2.0), vendored + pinned under source/ at the commit in UPSTREAM_COMMIT.txt.
# The property is a demonstration of the recoverability property class (a RELATIONAL
# datapath target) on real silicon, not a vulnerability finding.
