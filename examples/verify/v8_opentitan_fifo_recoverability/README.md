## The question

A FIFO that must not wedge raises a branching-time question: from any fill level it
can reach, can it always get back to **empty**? That is recoverability, `AG EF empty`.
But "empty" is not a control-FSM state — in `prim_fifo_sync_cnt.sv` it is a **relation
over two datapath registers**:

```systemverilog
assign empty_o = wptr_wrap_cnt_q == rptr_wrap_cnt_q;   // line 63
```

So the recoverability target is **relational** (`REG == REG`), decided by mununu's
compound-good machinery rather than a `REG == VALUE` control atom:

```
recoverable        = mu X. (empty || <> X)            # EF empty
always_recoverable = nu Y. (recoverable && [] Y)      # AG EF empty
        with  empty = (wptr_wrap_cnt_q == rptr_wrap_cnt_q)
```

The `<>` (some-successor) inside the `[]` (all-successors) is the branching content a
linear formalism (LTL / SVA) cannot state.

## What decides it — the ranking certificate

Reset is tied **inactive** in both runs, so recoverability rests on the *datapath* drain
(reads catching the write pointer), not a reset escape.

| Setup | `always_recoverable` | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Small FIFO** (`Depth=16`, ≤ ~40 bits of pointer state) | **`Holds`** | exact 3-valued engine (enumerates the pointer state) |
| **Wide FIFO** (`Depth=2^21`, 22-bit pointers, beyond the exact cap) | **`Holds`** | the **ranking certificate** over the exact transition — exact walls, the predicate cube abstains |

`empty` (`wptr == rptr`) is **not invariant** — the two wrap counters advance
**independently** (writes vs. reads), so `wptr == rptr` is *achieved* by draining, a
well-founded descent. No bounded predicate set captures a 2²¹-step descent, so the
predicate cube alone abstains. mununu's **ranking certificate** decides it directly over
the exact transition (Podelski–Rybalchenko): for the ranking δ = `wptr − rptr`, a single
SMT query proves that from every non-empty state *some* input (a read) strictly decreases
δ; with δ bounded below, that forces a descent to empty — so `AG EF empty` **Holds**, in
~0.1 s at 2²¹ depth.

The `∃`-input form is what fits a FIFO: only *some* input drains it, so `AG EF empty`
holds but `AG AF empty` does **not** (the environment may write forever). The all-path
variant of the certificate correctly *fails* here and is reserved for deterministic
descents (down-counters, timers).

This is the value: mununu can *state and soundly decide* a relational branching-time
property — one SVA cannot express — on real RTL **at a scale where bit-level engines and
predicate abstraction both give out**, without over-claiming (it still soundly abstains
where the property genuinely needs a ranking argument no certificate finds).

## Run it

```bash
LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/z3/lib cargo build -p mununu-cli
./examples/verify/v8_opentitan_fifo_recoverability/validate.sh
```

Requires `sv2v`, `yosys`, and `python3` on `PATH` (the standard plain-SV → BTOR2 flow,
same as `v7`). The two wrap-pointer counters are the only state; `validate.sh` names
the two anonymous state lines `cnta` / `cntb` (the `empty` relation is symmetric) and
targets `cnta == cntb`.
