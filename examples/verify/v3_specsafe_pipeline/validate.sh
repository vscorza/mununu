# validate.sh — V.3 speculative non-interference (vulnerable vs safe). §Phase 7
# domain validation; controlling doc docs/design/industrial-value-and-validation-domains.md §6.
#
# For each design:
#   1. Re-generate into a tmp dir and diff against the checked-in vulnerable/
#      safe/ (the generator is deterministic).
#   2. Run `mununu verify` and assert the verdicts:
#        deadlock_freedom = true  (both)
#        noninterference  = true under safe / false under vulnerable
#        leak_reachable   = false under safe / true under vulnerable
#      noninterference (= never(Leak) on the self-composed product) is the
#      discriminating contract-conformance verdict; leak_reachable (its dual,
#      = reachable(Leak)) is the non-vacuity witness.
#
# Non-interference is a 2-safety hyperproperty verified by SELF-COMPOSITION:
# two copies run with the same public input but independent secrets; the
# property reduces to ordinary safety on the product (never(Leak)). The model
# is a generated design-pattern demonstration of the speculative-non-interference
# domain — an abstract speculation→cache side-channel model, NOT an RTL pipeline
# and NOT a production Spectre checker (research-grade; claims-integrity).
