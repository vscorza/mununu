# validate.sh — V.9 recoverability showcase on OpenTitan prim_count (a hardened counter).
#
# Asks a branching-time question SVA cannot state, in BOTH directions on the SAME real primitive:
#   (1) DESCENT  — "from any count, can the counter always get back to zero?"    (AG EF cnt==0)
#   (2) ASCENT   — "from any count, can the counter always fill to max credit?"  (AG EF cnt==MAX)
#     always_recoverable = nu Y. ((mu X. (cnt==GOAL || <> X)) && [] Y)
# The counter is a real OpenTitan `prim_count` (step=1, no clear/set, see count_top.sv). Reaching
# zero is a well-founded DESCENT; reaching MAX = 2^Width-1 is a well-founded ASCENT — both the
# RANKING class, which no bounded predicate set captures. mununu's RANKING CERTIFICATE decides
# each over the exact transition: from every off-goal state SOME input strictly moves a
# well-founded measure toward the goal — δ = cnt for the descent (bounded below by 0), δ = MAX−cnt
# for the ascent (bounded below by 0). The certificate tries BOTH measure directions, so one
# extraction decides both properties (∃-input variant, one relation each).
#
# RESULT: both `AG EF (cnt == 0)` and `AG EF (cnt == MAX)` decide HOLDS on a 48-bit prim_count,
# where the exact BDD engine walls and the predicate cube abstains. A SINGLE-REGISTER ranking in
# TWO directions on a real hardened primitive — a different shape from v8's relational FIFO drain.
#
# Note on the extraction: prim_count is HARDENED — it carries a redundant SECONDARY counter (for
# fault detection) and an FPV backdoor. Those leave wide signals in the lifted BTOR2 that do not
# touch the primary count's evolution; the ranking certificate's cone-of-influence input filter
# ignores them (it enumerates only inputs in the counted register's next-state cone).
#
# Pedigree: prim_count.sv + prim_count_pkg.sv are real OpenTitan RTL (Apache-2.0), pinned under
# source/ at the commit in UPSTREAM_COMMIT.txt. prim_flop.sv is a minimal register matching
# OpenTitan's abstract-prim flop interface (identical to prim_generic_flop); count_top.sv is a
# thin down-counter harness (the usage configuration). A property-class demonstration on real
# silicon, not a vulnerability finding.
