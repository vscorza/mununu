# validate.sh — V.7-b recoverability showcase on OpenTitan uart_tx, with a
# COMPOUND idle predicate.
#
# Asks a branching-time question SVA cannot state: "while transmitting, can the
# UART always drain its frame and get back to idle?" — i.e. recoverability,
#     always_recoverable = nu Y. ((mu X. (idle || <> X)) && [] Y)   (AG EF idle)
# over a predicate abstraction of the real RTL. Unlike the csrng showcase
# (V.7-c), uart_tx's idle is NOT a single state-enum value — it is a COMPOUND
# condition over two registers:
#     idle = (bit_cnt_q == 0) && (sreg_q == 2047)   # counter drained AND shift reg back to its idle pattern
# declared in source/idle.mununu.json. The cube lift routes compounds through the
# eager SmtAllPairs may-relation + SMT hyper-must edges (B.1 + B.2), so the
# alternating-fixpoint (νμ) verdict is clean-sound — no soundness-tag.
#
# The contrast is bug-vs-fix, NOT reset-dependence (uart_tx self-recovers, so
# both reset variants of the correct design hold). We tie tx_enable=1 and
# rst_ni=1 (actively transmitting, no external reset) so the verdict reflects the
# design's OWN ability to drain a frame:
#
#   * upstream uart_tx              -> always_recoverable HOLDS (definite-TRUE):
#       the bit counter decrements each baud tick, so every started frame drains
#       back to idle.
#   * planted-bug uart_tx_stuck.sv -> always_recoverable VIOLATED (definite-FALSE):
#       the ONE-LINE change removes the decrement, so a started frame never drains
#       and the FSM cannot return to idle.
#
# Both verdicts are definite (no KleeneBot) and sound for the model
# (Bruns-Godefroid preservation; the GKMTS hyper-must edges make the νμ verdict
# monotone under refinement per Shoham-Grumberg LMCS 2007).
#
# Pedigree: uart_tx.sv is real OpenTitan RTL (Apache-2.0), vendored + pinned
# under ../m1_opentitan_uart_tx/source/ (M.1). This fixture reuses that source
# for the correct variant and ships a deliberately broken copy
# (source/uart_tx_stuck.sv) for the bug variant. The planted bug is a
# DESIGN-PATTERN DEMONSTRATION of the recoverability property class, NOT a
# vulnerability finding — OpenTitan's real UART is correct.
