# validate.sh — R46-6 / GAP-2 on REAL OpenTitan RTL: per-cluster slicing ×
# param-concretization compose to verify a design neither primitive can fit
# alone.
#
# Fixture: two independent `pattgen_chan` instances (vendored OpenTitan,
# pinned in source/UPSTREAM_COMMIT.txt) wrapped by a hand-written harness
# that narrows the 116-bit ctrl_i struct to a small constant config + a free
# per-channel enable. Each channel carries the channel's wide state
# (prediv_q[32], data_q[64], clk_cnt_q[32], reps_q/rep_cnt_q[10], …).
#
# Contract, in three checks:
#   1. NO sidecar → REJECTED at 338 raw state bits (2 × 169). The raw real
#      RTL is hopeless without abstraction.
#   2. Sidecar but a SINGLE property → REJECTED at 28 state bits: the joint
#      design, even with every wide cell concretized, is still 2 × 14 > 20,
#      and a single cone gives one cluster so per-cluster cannot split it.
#      → per-cluster slicing is load-bearing, not just concretization.
#   3. Sidecar + TWO disjoint properties → automatic per-cluster fires,
#      slices each channel into its own cluster (14 effective bits each),
#      and both reachability properties come back SATISFIED + non-vacuous
#      (128-state clusters — i.e. the concretized wide cells, NOT a
#      degenerate sliced-away cone), each over a distinct cluster automaton.
#
# The reachability verdict is the same shape as the R46-5 mechanism fixture
# (`mu X. (done || <>X)`); this fixture's purpose is the abstraction-
# composition mechanism on real RTL, not a deep property finding. Each
# channel's counter escapes its concretized set → an OOB sink (the 129th
# state), the shape the realize numericity-gate fix (PR #94) makes sound.
#
# Like the other R46 fixtures, the BTOR2 is produced in mununu's own temp
# dir, so nothing cap-busting lands under examples/.
