# validate.sh — R46-6 / GAP-2 at K=5 on REAL OpenTitan RTL: per-cluster
# slicing × param-concretization across five independent detectors.
#
# Fixture: five `sysrst_ctrl_detect` instances (vendored OpenTitan, pinned
# in source/UPSTREAM_COMMIT.txt) wrapped by a hand-written harness. Each
# detector is one of sysrst_ctrl's debounce/detect sub-blocks and carries
# the vendored block's 32-bit detect/debounce timer counter (`cnt_q`) —
# the exact wide field the R.4.6 plan named as the sysrst cap-buster.
#
# Contract, in three checks (two load-bearing negatives + composed):
#   1. NO sidecar → REJECTED at 172 raw state bits (5 × 32-bit timers +
#      FSM flops). The raw RTL is hopeless without abstraction.
#   2. Sidecar but a SINGLE property → REJECTED at 27 state bits: the joint
#      design, even with all five timers concretized, is still > 20, and a
#      single cone gives one cluster so per-cluster cannot split it.
#      → per-cluster slicing is load-bearing on top of concretization.
#   3. Sidecar + FIVE disjoint properties → automatic per-cluster fires,
#      slices each detector into its own cluster (Circuit__cl0..cl4), and
#      all five reachability properties come back SATISFIED + non-vacuous
#      (32–64 state clusters — the concretized timer + FSM, NOT a
#      degenerate sliced-away cone), each over a distinct cluster automaton.
#
# Verdict shape = the R46-5 mechanism fixture (`mu X. (det || <>X)`); this
# fixture's purpose is the abstraction-composition mechanism on real RTL at
# K=5, not a deep property finding. Each timer escapes its concretized set
# at the threshold → an OOB sink, the shape the realize numericity-gate fix
# (PR #94) makes sound.
#
# The included `prim_assert.sv` resolves on the verify path because the
# sv2v staging tempdir is on the include search path (the same PR that adds
# this fixture).
