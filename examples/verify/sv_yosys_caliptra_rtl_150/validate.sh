# validate.sh — Caliptra-RTL #150 SoC interface boot FSM (Phase A.3 sanity).
#
# Runs the sv-yosys → BTOR2 pipeline on chipsalliance/caliptra-rtl's
# `soc_ifc_boot_fsm_pre_fix.sv` and asserts that:
#
#   (a) translation completes (no Yosys / bit-blast errors),
#   (b) the auto-partition + sidecar abstractions land the design under
#       the BTOR2 bit-blaster's MAX_STATE_BITS = 20 cap with a
#       state-count well below 2^19 (the raw bit width before
#       abstraction). Before Phase A.3 the pipeline could not finish on
#       this design in 22 minutes / 4.6 GB RSS on a release build —
#       see docs/design/caliptra-abstraction-analysis.md §2.2.
#
# This is a **structural sanity check**, not a property-verification
# claim. The mu-calculus evaluator does return verdicts on this design
# (set EVAL=1 to exercise that path under a 5-minute cap), but the
# verdicts are **vacuous** — formula atoms like `boot_fsm_ps == 5` do
# not yet bind to state-cell valuations on the bit-blasted CLTS, so
# every state "satisfies" the negation by default. The CWE-1245
# UNDEF-state reachability finding cannot be cited as a verdict
# claim until state-cell-aware predicate binding ships (separate
# scope from Phase A.3).
#
# Per docs/policies/claims-integrity.md this fixture demonstrates an
# auto-extraction structural milestone on a real upstream design.
