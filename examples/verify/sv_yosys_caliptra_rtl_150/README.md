## M.4 — predicate-abstraction CEGAR

`validate_m4_cegar.sh` runs the R.5 predicate-cube CEGAR path
(sv2v → Yosys `setundef -anyconst` → BTOR2 → `mununu btor2 cegar` with
per-target SMT-proved must-edge inference) on both the bug-bearing
`pre_fix` and fixed `post_fix` variants.

Property: `<> (p5 || p6 || p7)` over the cube `{boot_fsm_ns ∈ {5,6,7}}` —
"the next-state register can transition into an unmatched (undefined)
`boot_fsm_state_e` encoding" (the legal encodings are 0..4; the
default-less `unique casez` leaves 5/6/7 unhandled — CWE-1245).

```
pre_fix  (no default arm):       verdict cells T=7 F=1 ⊥=0  → hazard DEFINITE
post_fix (default holds + reset): verdict cells T=4 F=1 ⊥=3  → hazard INDEFINITE (⊥)
```

The undefined-encoding latch is **definitely** present in the bug-bearing
variant (every cell decided, ⊥=0) and **no longer definite** in the fixed
variant (≥1 undefined-encoding cell is KleeneBot) — the sound pre/post
difference is the milestone evidence.

**Soundness (revised 2026-06-22, IR-track P3.4).** The original claim —
post_fix `T=0`, "hazard UNREACHABLE, fix verified" — was **unsound**: it
relied on a Skolem-collapsed `<>`→`[]` diamond (one shared `step` label ⇒
"all step-successors satisfy") that ignored the cube's over-approximating
may-self-loops. Under the corrected EXISTENTIAL `Control::All` diamond,
post_fix is genuinely **KleeneBot**, not definite-safe — and rightly so:
post_fix's `default: boot_fsm_ns = boot_fsm_ps` *holds* the undefined
encoding, escaping only via the reset window (`boot_fsm_ps <= arc_IDLE ?
BOOT_IDLE : boot_fsm_ns`). So the `{p5,p6,p7}` cube **cannot soundly prove
the fixed FSM safe**; it soundly shows the *definite* hazard is gone.
Must-edges are Z3-proved (∀∀, no sampling); `setundef -anyconst`
over-approximates power-up. Proving full post_fix safety would need a finer
abstraction / CEGAR to convergence (out of scope). RTL-level
counterexample replay under a cycle-accurate simulator remains the deferred
empirical step. This reproduces the known caliptra-rtl #150 bug/fix pair
via the automated pipeline (as a sound definite→indefinite distinction).

```bash
cargo build -p mununu-cli
./validate_m4_cegar.sh        # requires yosys + sv2v on PATH
```

## What this exercises

Runs the `sv-yosys → BTOR2 → bit-blast` pipeline on
chipsalliance/caliptra-rtl's
[`soc_ifc_boot_fsm.sv`](https://github.com/chipsalliance/caliptra-rtl/issues/150)
(`pre_fix` variant, the bug-bearing source). The headline measurement:

| Metric | Before Phase A.3 | After Phase A.3 |
|---|---|---|
| Bit-blaster verdict | killed at 22 min / 4.6 GB RSS | completes in seconds |
| Realised state count | n/a (didn't finish) | **4 096** |
| Raw state-cell width | 2^19 = 524 288 | unchanged (abstraction reduces enumeration, not width) |
| Reduction factor | — | **128×** |

The reduction comes from **two composing mechanisms**:

1. **Sidecar-declared abstractions** (`wait_count`, `fw_update_rst_wait_cycles`,
   `BootFSM_BrkPoint`, `BootFSM_Continue`) — user wins on collision per
   the Phase A.3 §3.5 policy.
2. **Auto cone-of-influence** — runs but does not classify any new
   drops on this fixture, because the user-curated sidecar already
   lists every relevant signal. The auto-COI pass is exercised through
   the same code path that drove the headline reduction on smaller
   designs (see
   [`crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/dep_graph.rs`](../../../crates/mununu-core/src/adapter/btor2/dep_graph.rs))
   and is observable in the bit-blaster's pre-partition state-count
   warning (`2^19 = 524288 explicit states` → post-abstraction 4 096).

## Phase A.4 update (2026-05-20) — verdict-flip blocked by state-bit cap

The Phase A.4 predicate-image discovery algorithm is **complete** and
**correct**, but the Caliptra `no_undef_reachable` verdict-flip
criterion is **not yet achieved**. The trade-off measured:

| Yosys `setundef` pass | State bits | Predicate-image finds `boot_fsm_ns ∈` | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-zero` (default) | 19 → 4 096 states | **{0, 1, 2, 3, 4} only** | 1/1 initial satisfies — CWE-1245 silently masked |
| `-anyseq` (opt-in via `MUNUNU_YOSYS_SETUNDEF_ANYSEQ=1`) | **56 — over MAX_STATE_BITS=20 cap** | **{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}** (bug encodings surface) | Cannot translate (bit-blaster refuses) |

So the algorithm works in isolation (Step 4.4's `mununu btor2 discover`
on the `-anyseq`-emitted BTOR2 surfaces the violating encodings), but
the full `sv-yosys → BTOR2 → bit-blast → eval` pipeline cannot close
the verdict because the bug-preserving `-anyseq` synthesis pass
explodes the state space past the explicit-state engine's reach.
This matches the [Phase A.4 plan's anticipated fallback](../../../.claude/plans/phase-a4-predicate-image.md#proof-by-fire-target-validation-contract):
the gap is **measured**, not unknown.

**Next-step options** (deferred to the A.4b follow-up plan):
1. **Lift the bit-blast cap** to absorb the `$anyseq` cells —
   impractical at 2^56 explicit states.
2. **Compose-and-decompose** (Phase 3 of the BTOR2 roadmap) to split
   the design and verify pieces under the cap.
3. **Phase B (IC3-IA)** — implicit predicate abstraction inside an IC3
   prover doesn't materialise the state space, so the bit-blast cap
   doesn't apply.
4. **Sidecar-side workaround**: use the default `-zero` synthesis but
   author a sidecar that explicitly declares the bug-bearing branches
   via `predicates {}` blocks the mu-calculus formula references
   directly. Cheap but model-specific.

The end-to-end "first auto-extracted real-upstream-bug finding" claim
in [proof-by-fire-findings.md](../../../docs/design/proof-by-fire-findings.md)
remains **partially open** — see the Phase A.4 update there for the
full record.

## Status

> **Source of truth:** [`validate.sh`](validate.sh) (asserts state-count
> cap) — surface: CLI-only — this is an example fixture, not a CLI
> capability.
> **Status: structural milestone end-to-end; verdict is not yet a
> finding.** Two layers report cleanly:
>
> 1. **Translation + bit-blast:** completes in seconds. State count
>    4 096 (raw bit width 2^19 = 524 288 → 128× reduction via the
>    sidecar's `wait_count` bounded counter + per-input `Ignored` /
>    `BoundedCounter` declarations).
> 2. **Mu-calculus evaluation:** completes in roughly 2–3 minutes on a
>    debug build (sets the Phase A roadmap's runtime gate at ≈ 5 min
>    wall-clock). All three sidecar properties — `no_undef_reachable`,
>    `boot_idle_reachable`, `safety_all_states_have_successors` —
>    return verdicts.
>
> However, the verdicts are **not a property claim** today. The
> formula atoms (`boot_fsm_ps == 5 || boot_fsm_ps == 6 ||

> The earlier "CTXDSL re-parse" blocker (`unexpected token

> `--sidecar foo.mununu.json` is now treated as informational (the

> Per

> abstraction landed the design under the bit-blaster's
