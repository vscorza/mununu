// compute_engine.sv — a self-contained "load → busy → done" compute core.
//
// Authored for mununu as a PUBLIC, permissively-licensed (this repo's license) reproducer of
// the branching-time RECOVERABILITY differentiator — the class of property no bit-level,
// safety-only tool (SVA assertion checker, plain BMC) can express.
//
// The differentiator, in one line:
//     AG EF (busy == 0)   — "from EVERY reachable state, the core can return to idle"
// paired with its non-vacuity witness  EF (busy == 1)  ("the core genuinely goes busy", so the
// recovery is not trivially true). A safety checker can only say "busy is low on THIS trace";
// only a branching-time engine says "idle is ALWAYS re-reachable, from anywhere". mununu decides
// it exactly over the bit-blasted state space (3-valued KMTS mu-calculus), soundly.
//
// Why this design is a *meaningful* (non-vacuous) example — the property gate mununu's own work
// applies (see the benchmark-property discipline): the recovery target `busy==0` is genuinely
// LEFT (busy goes high on `start`) and always re-reached (the FSM returns to IDLE), so the HOLDS
// is a real recoverability claim, not a stuck-signal vacuity. Its activity is self-contained: the
// WORK phase advances on its own clock with no external handshake, so the whole busy↔idle cycle is
// reachable in module isolation.
//
// The properties are carried as `@mununu_guarantee` mu-calculus annotations (verified by
// `mununu sv verify-auto`). Run out-of-reset (`--config-value rst_n=1`) — see README.md.

// AG EF(idle): from every reachable state, the core can return to idle (the recovery).
// @mununu_guarantee nu Y.((mu X.(busy==0 || <> X)) && [] Y)
// Non-vacuity witness: busy is genuinely reachable, so the recovery above is not trivially true.
// @mununu_guarantee mu Z.(busy==1 || <> Z)
// AG EF(done): from every reachable state, the core can always complete a computation.
