# btor2tools example suite — provenance

These BTOR2 safety benchmarks are vendored **byte-for-byte** from the upstream
[Boolector/btor2tools](https://github.com/Boolector/btor2tools) `examples/btorsim/`
directory, at commit `d33c73ff1d173f1bfac8ba6b1c6d68ba62c55f8e`. They are real,
hand-independent model-checking benchmarks (some, e.g. `ponylink-*`, are extracted
from published hardware) used here as an **independent reachability oracle**: each
carries `bad` properties whose reachability `mununu`'s exact engine
(`exact_bad_reachable`) is cross-checked against **btormc** in
`hwmcc_style_coverage_study` (differential_oracle_e2e.rs). Untouched — only read,
never rewritten (claims-integrity: models-from-source).

## The suite (why this spread)

The set is chosen to exercise every branch of the coverage study — what our exact
engine decides, what it soundly refuses, and where it hits the bit cap:

| File | bits | `bad` reachable? | mununu exact engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| `count2.btor2` | 3-bit counter | **yes** (reaches `0b111`) | decides (SAT) |
| `count4.btor2` | 4-bit counter | **yes** | decides (SAT) |
| `recount4.btor2` | 4-bit counter + enable/reset | **yes** | decides (SAT) |
| `twocount2.btor2` | two 2-bit counters | reachable | decides |
| `factorial4even.btor2` | 4-bit, uses `mul` | reachable | decides (exercises the `Mul` bit-blaster) |
| `twocount32.btor2` | 32-bit | — | decides / near cap |
| `noninitstate.btor2` | has a `constraint` | — | **refused** (constraint not modelled — soundness guard) |
| `twocount2c.btor2` | has a `constraint` | — | **refused** (constraint guard) |
| `ponylink-slaveTXlen-sat.btor2` | 228-bit, 320 states | **yes** (`-sat`) | **Skipped** (over the 40-bit cap) — btormc decides |

The `-sat` / `-unsat` filename suffix is the upstream competition convention for the
known verdict (`sat` = `bad` reachable / unsafe; `unsat` = safe). The study asserts
every verdict mununu's engine emits AGREES with btormc; it never fails on a
`Skipped`/refused case (that is honest coverage, not a wrong answer).
